### Camperships

The Connecticut Rivers Council is pleased to offer camperships to Scouts who are members of the Connecticut Rivers Council who attend Connecticut Rivers Council Camp.  Camperships are subject to available funding. Camperships are the equivalent of a school scholarship but for summer camp. They are awarded based upon financial need as determined by the most recent 1040 tax form.  Extenuating circumstances may be considered.   

**Except** on rare occasions, Camperships are **NOT** granted for amounts greater than 50% of the camp fee.  Camperships are awarded for ONE (1) camp session per Scout.  Camperships are not transferrable between Scouts.  Please file a separate application for EACH individual in a household requesting a Campership (however only one tax form is required to be provided to the council per family).  

The deadline for the submissions is April 1^st.  Any Campership applications received after April 1^st (or incomplete campership applications not completed before April 1^st) will be put into a pool for consideration of any remaining funds.

### Payments

**All** payments for camp **must** be made online
through the Connecticut Rivers Council web site.
Payments may be in the form of an E-Check or credit card.

### 2018 Connecticut Rivers Council Summer Camp Refund Policy

The Connecticut Rivers Council must commit financial resources to purchase
equipment, hire staff, and otherwise prepare to provide the high quality
programs in our camps they have come to be expected well in advance of the camps opening for the summer. Participants therefore
must also make a financial commitment to attend. Refund requests made before
June 15^th will be for the amount paid minus the cencellation fee of $75. Requests after June 15^th
will be for the amount paid minus $125.

All requests for refund consideration are to be in writing and sent either in
the form of a letter or email to:
