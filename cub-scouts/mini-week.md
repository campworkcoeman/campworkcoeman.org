Cub Experience Camp is a 3 day, 2 night mini camp that is great for all Cub
Scouts who are looking to try a resident camp with their adult partner. This
camp is especially designed for Cubs who have never been away at camp and will
have a blast experiencing all that camp has to offer.

Camp Workcoeman has lots of fun activities for a Cub Scout to experience
including:

* Swimming
* BB Shooting
* Boating
* Sports
* Archery
* Crafts
* Nature
* Campfires

Scouts and their adult partners will have a great time sleeping in tents,
eating in the camp dining hall, and having a great time exploring the vast Camp
Workcoeman reservation.

All the fun takes place under the watchful eye of our highly trained and
certified staff ensuring a safe and fun experience. Camp Workcoeman is a
Nationally Accredited Camp by the BSA and has a long history in Scouting since
1924.

Cub Experience Camp promotes fun with a purpose and allows Cub Scouts to work
on some advancement as well.
