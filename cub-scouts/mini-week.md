### ~~August 9--12, 2020 and August 12--15, 2020~~

Cub Scout Sleepaway Camp is a 4 day, 3 night mini camp that is great for all Cub
Scouts who are looking to try a resident camp with their adult partner. This
camp is especially designed for Cubs who have never been away at camp and will
have a blast experiencing all that camp has to offer.

Camp Workcoeman has lots of fun activities for a Cub Scout to experience
including:

* Swimming
* BB Shooting
* Boating
* Sports
* Archery
* Crafts
* Nature
* Campfires

Scouts and their adult partners will have a great time sleeping in tents,
eating in the camp dining hall, and having a great time exploring the vast Camp
Workcoeman reservation.

All the fun takes place under the watchful eye of our highly trained and
certified staff ensuring a safe and fun experience. Camp Workcoeman is a
Nationally Accredited Camp by the BSA and has a long history in Scouting since
1924.

Cub Experience Camp promotes fun with a purpose and allows Cub Scouts to work
on some advancement as well.

Be sure to sign up today and don't miss out! For even more fun, sign up for both
sessions to spend a full week at camp.
