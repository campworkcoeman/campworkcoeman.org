## Cub Scout Nature Experience --- May 22, 2021

Cub Scouts are invited to Camp Workcoeman for a day of fun learning about the nature around them! They will take a nature hike where they learn to identify plants (including some edible ones), participate in rock identification and a scavenger hunt, shoot BBs and archery, and more. This program will run from 10 AM--2 PM and lunch will be provided. For check in, please bring a Health Form parts A-B as well as the COVID questionnaire.
