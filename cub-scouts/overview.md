## Free Style Family Camp

#### August 10--12, 2020 and August 12--14, 2020

We are excited to announce that Camp Workcoeman will be offering a dynamic new
camping program for the summer of 2020. This new program is a Family Camping
free-style program that will allow open program times and unmatched flexibility
for you and your family. With this fresh new program, we will also be able to
provide exciting opportunities for the entire family of Scouting. This program
will offer something for all ages, Cubs right through to Scouts BSA. It is also
open to families and friends who are non-scouts (just one person in the party
needs to be a member of Scouting).
