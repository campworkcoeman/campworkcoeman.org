Days are filled with swimming, boating, archery, BB shooting, crafts, nature exploration, STEM activities, and campfire programs. Evenings bring songs, laughter, and the unforgettable spirit of Scouting around the campfire. Resident Camp is the perfect opportunity for Scouts to build confidence, learn new skills, earn adventure pins and belt loops, and make lasting friendships.
