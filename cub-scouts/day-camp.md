### July 15--19 and August 5--9, 2024

Camp Workcoeman will once again host a week long Cub Scout Day Camp!

Day Camp is a great way for your Cub Scout age son or daughter to experience the thrill of the outdoors and is a good introduction to independence from mom and dad without being too far from home. The week-long program fills each day with the adventure and experiences that families join the Scouting program for.  Activities include archery, BB, swimming, crafts, nature, STEM, and much more.

Day Camp runs 8:30 AM -- 4:00 PM and also features several special activities including a cookout, campfire, and awards ceremony. Lunch is included.

All the fun takes place under the watchful eye of our highly trained and
certified staff ensuring a safe and fun experience. Camp Workcoeman is a
Nationally Accredited Camp by the BSA and has a long history in Scouting since
1924.
