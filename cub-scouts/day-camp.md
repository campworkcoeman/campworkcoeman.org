### August 14--18, 2017

Camp Workcoeman will once again host a week long Cub Scout Day Camp!

It is a 5 day program perfect for Tiger, Wolf, and Bear Scouts. Day camp has
all the fun of a summer camp experience without the overnight element. Scouts
will have a blast swimming, learning new skills, becoming a top shot on the BB
and archery ranges, learning new games on the Sports Field, and having fun in
the Crafts Lodge.

Day Camp also features several special activities including a Blue and Gold
pot-luck dinner and fellowship campfire.

All the fun takes place under the watchful eye of our highly trained and
certified staff ensuring a safe and fun experience. Camp Workcoeman is a
Nationally Accredited Camp by the BSA and has a long history in Scouting since
1924.

Be sure to sign up for this summer blast today!
