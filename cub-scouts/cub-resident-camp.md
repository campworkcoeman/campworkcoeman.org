### August 5--10, 2018

Fun, adventure, and excitement await all Cub Scouts at Camp Workcoeman! This
action-packed 6 day, 5 night resident camp is designed for Cubs entering first
through third grades. Activities are planned for each den so you know the
program is always age-appropriate.

The Camp Workcoeman Staff has prepared a variety of activities for Scouts to
enjoy including:

* Swimming
* BB Shooting
* Wilderness Trek
* Boating
* Archery
* Fishing
* Nature
* Campfires

Scouts will spend the entire week in the outdoors sleeping in our campsite
tents, eating in the camp dining hall, and having a great time exploring the
vast Camp Workcoeman reservation.

All the fun takes place under the watchful eye of our highly trained and
certified staff ensuring a safe and fun experience. Camp Workcoeman is a
Nationally Accredited Camp by the BSA and has a long history in Scouting since
1924.

Cub Scouts will not only experience the fun of camp, they will also have ample
opportunity to work on belt loops and pins as well.
