This action-packed 6 day, 5 night resident camp is designed for first and

of activities for Scouts to enjoy including:

* Swimming
* BB Shooting
* Wilderness Trek
* Boating

* Fishing
* Nature
* Campfires

Scouts will spend the entire week in the outdoors sleeping in our campsite
tents, eating in the camp dining hall, and having a great time exploring the
vast Camp Workcoeman reservation.

All the fun takes place under the watchful eye of our highly trained and
certified staff ensuring a safe and fun experience. Camp Workcoeman is a
Nationally Accredited Camp by the BSA and has a long history in Scouting since
1924.

Webelos Scouts will not only experience the fun of camp, they will also have
ample opportunity to work on advancement as well. Be sure to sign up today!
