    <p><b>Camp Workcoeman is currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</b> There will be no camping, work days, etc. until further notice. <em>The staff is continuing to plan for a summer camp program,</em> as it receives guidance from local and state health officials. We recommend that Scout Troops and Packs do the same and we will be in touch regarding any changes that need to be made. Please know that we will do everything we can to provide a summer camp experience, however the safety of the Scouts, staff and guests is and will always be our top priority.</p>
