    <p><em>21 June 2020</em> &mdash; As of 17 June 2020, units in the Connecticut Rivers Council can resume in-person activities per updated state guidance. Please see <a href="https://ctscouting.org/covid-19-council-update/">ctscouting.org</a> for full details. Information on opportunities for the use of camp properties will be announced shortly.</p>
    <p><em>16 June 2020</em> &mdash; <b>Camp Workcoeman has now reopened in a very limited capacity, but all regularly scheduled summer programs remain canceled.</b> There will be no camping until further notice, but limited work days have now resumed while following Council, state, and CDC guidance. Beaver Day is postponed indefinitely. Activities may be possible in the late summer and early fall if conditions permit. We do not yet know what these activities will look like; however, the safety of our Scouts, staff, and guests is and will always be our top priority.</p>
