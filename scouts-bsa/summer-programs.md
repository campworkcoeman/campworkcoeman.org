Building on last year's progress, the summer 2022 season at Camp Workcoeman will consist of a series of one and two session daytime merit badge classes. Several skills clinics are available as well as a full-week scuba certification course. Additionally, overnight unit and family camping will be offered any night throughout the summer. These programs are not designed to replicate a traditional summer camp experience; rather, they are intended to supplement one through a variety of flexible programs.
