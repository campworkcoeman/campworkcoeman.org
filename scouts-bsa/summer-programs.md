The summer 2021 season at Camp Workcoeman will be atypical but nonetheless rewarding. A series of one and two session daytime merit badge classes will be offered mid-week and on weekends. Additionally, overnight unit and family camping will be offered any night throughout the summer. These programs are not designed to replicate a traditional summer camp experience; rather, they are intended to supplement one through a variety of flexible programs.

More information will be posted shortly.
