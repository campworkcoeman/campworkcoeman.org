## Going to the BSA's Florida Sea Base? Get your SCUBA certification at Workcoeman!

Is your unit planning on attending the Florida Sea Base? If so, get your required SCUBA certification while staying at Camp Workcoeman. Located in the scenic hills of northwestern Connecticut, Camp Workcoeman boasts one of the cleanest lakes around---perfect for learning to SCUBA dive locally in New England.

## Discover Scuba

Camp Workcoeman is entering new waters.

In conjunction with outside instructors, Camp Workcoeman will offer Discover Scuba courses at
camp on the Sundays of our two Waterfront Weeks. This course will introduce you to Scuba diving and allow you to earn the Scuba BSA award.

Certified instructors will come to camp and offer a full Discover Scuba course. The Discover
Scuba Diving program lets you experience the thrill of diving under the
supervision of a scuba professional in confined conditions. During your
adventure, you'll master some basic concepts and scuba skills and will
experience an open water adventure.

The course is open to Scouts and Scouters and requires
an additional fee. Anyone interested should sign up early as
space is limited.

All participants must be in generally good health and complete a required
medical history and informed consent form (provided from camp).

## SDI Scuba Certification

During our two Waterfront weeks of Scouts BSA camp, outside instructors
will also offer a full open water certification course. The
cost of the full certification course is $375; families and units wishing to stay at camp must reserve a campsite separately.

Scouts will also work on BSA's Scuba Merit Badge and have the opportunity to
work on additional scuba programs.

Interested Scouts can sign up using the Connecticut Rivers Council Summer Camp
Registration Form or can contact camp directly.
