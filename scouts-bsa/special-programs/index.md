## Scuba

A new challenge for Scouts who would like to discover the depths of West
Hill Pond. During our two Waterfront Weeks, a professional instructor will come to camp to teach
Scouts about scuba diving. All participants will have a chance to
spend time under water to see what it is all about.

## Pistol Shooting Program

Camp Workcoeman is one of a select few camps that participates in the Boy Scouts of America's
Summer Camp Pistol Shooting Program. The program is open to all Scouts who are at least 13 and have
completed the eighth grade. Scouts will receive a safety briefing and instruction followed by the opportunity
to earn various pistol marksmanship qualifications. Due to the low instructor to shooter ratio, space is
extremely limited. The program runs July 18 and August 8, 2021 and costs $45. An additional signed
participation waiver is required.

## Huck Finn Tube Ride

Your troop can arrange for a tubing trip down the Farmington River through
Satan's Kingdom---a great way to spend a hot summer afternoon! Reservations
must be made in advance at the pre-camp planning meeting. Transportation to and
from the river is up to the troop. An additional fee and a completed parental
permission form is required for all youth participants. As this is considered
an individual troop activity, a Tour Permit must be submitted; this can be done
at the Camp Office. Please visit the
[Farmington River Tubing website](http://www.farmingtonrivertubing.com/) for
more information. A link to the parental waiver is located at the top of the
page.
