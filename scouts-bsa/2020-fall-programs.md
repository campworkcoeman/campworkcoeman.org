## Winter Camp --- December 27--30, 2020

Held between Christmas and New Year's Day 2021. Winter Camp is a unique experience where a Scout can earn merit badges and participate in activities that are not obtainable at a summer camp along with learning more about the outdoors. The weather, activities, training, and overall camp atmosphere are vastly unique to any other Scout program. This is not a Klondike Derby. It is an advancement and skills-based program that is exciting and fun. All meals will be provided and Scouts will be housed in cabins.  Sign-ups can be done as a unit or provisionally. Staff will be provided to provide supervision if troop leaders can't attend. All meals will be provided and Scouts have the option to stay in cabins or camp outside in personal tents.
