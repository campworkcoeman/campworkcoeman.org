## Winter Camp --- December 27--30, 2020

Held between Christmas and New Year's Day 2021. Winter Camp (day only) is a unique experience where a Scout can earn merit badges and participate in activities that are not obtainable at a summer camp along with learning more about the outdoors. The weather, activities, training, and overall camp atmosphere are vastly unique to any other Scout program. This is not a Klondike Derby. It is an advancement and skills-based program that is exciting and fun. Sign-ups can be done as a unit or provisionally. Staff will be provided to provide supervision if troop leaders can't attend.
