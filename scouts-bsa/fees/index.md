The fees to attend week-long Scouts BSA Resident Summer Camp in 2020 are as follows.

### Scout Fees

Early Fee: $435
: A $50 deposit per Scout camper is due no later than **March 15, 2020**.
  If paid in full by **May 1, 2020, the fee will be $435**; payments received
  after **May 1, 2020** will be charged the regular rate of $460.

Regular Fee: $460
: The fee is $460 for payments made between May 1, 2020 and June 15, 2020.

Late Fee: $495
: The fee is $495 for payments made after June 15, 2020.

### Discounts for Scouts

Encore (2^nd week of camp): $335
: The registration process will require the Scout's other camp/week to be
  identified. To qualify, a Scout must have already spent a week in a
  **Scouts BSA Camp or National High Adventure Base**, and the discount applies to a
  second (or more) week at one of the Connecticut Rivers Council's camps.

Sibling Discount:
: A $25 discount will be given to help out those families with siblings
  attending Resident Camp. The discount will apply to each sibling from the same
  family.

### Adult Scouter Fees

Fees for extra Scouters are calculated at **$20 per day** or **$120 for the full week**. Names of
Scouters are not required until May 15. Two Scouters are free. Additional
Scouters may be free according to the schedule below:

 # of youth per program | # of free Scouters | all additional adults
------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------
  5--10                 | 2                  | $120
 11--20                 | 3                  | $120
 21--30                 | 4                  | $120
 31--40                 | 5                  | $120

### Webelos Crossovers & New Scouts --- $435

These Scouts are always afforded the lowest possible camp fee rate. Because
many troops don't know what Webelos will be joining their troop until after the
March 15^th deposit date, a special registration category will be established for
them. This will also include any youth who join the troop as new Scouts between
March 15^th and the beginning of the troop's week at camp.

### Camperships

The Connecticut Rivers Council makes an effort to see that all Scouts have the
chance to benefit from the programs offered at our three Camps. Should a Scout's
family be in a financial situation where assistance is needed, they may apply
for a campership. Please know that camperships do not cover the full cost of
registration, and are subject to approval by the Campership Committee.

### Specialty Camp Programs

Registration for all Specialty Camp programs will be accomplished by the
individual. These programs will include Trail to Eagle and various other daily 
or weekend programs.

### FAQs

Question
: I don't know what Scouts in my troop are going to attend camp by the March
15^th Early Fee deposit date. Why should I make a deposit for the "unknown"?

Answer
: Camp promotion is a year round process. The unit's camp plans should already
  be on the family's calendars. Units also should have a pretty good idea of
  the percentage of Scouts in the troop that attends camp. Register and make
  deposits for that number of Scouts you think will be attending. Deposits may later be
  transferred between Scouts.

<br/>
Question
: We know our troop has Scouts that need Campership assistance in order to
  attend camp. Should we register them with a $50 deposit by March 15^th?

Answer
: Yes, as stated above, campership applicants are always
  afforded the lowest possible camp fee. Naming them by March 15^th helps the Camp
  Directors in planning for a great summer program.

### 2020 Connecticut Rivers Council Summer Camp Refund Policy

The Connecticut Rivers Council must commit financial resources to purchase
equipment, hire staff, and otherwise prepare to provide the high quality
programs in our camps well in advance of the camps opening for the summer. Participants therefore
must also be prepared to make a financial commitment to attend.

Refund requests made before
June 15^th will be reimbursed the fee minus the cancellation fee of $75. Requests after June 15^th
will be reimbursed the fee minus the cancellation fee of $150.

All requests for refund consideration are to be in writing and sent either in
the form of a letter or email to:
