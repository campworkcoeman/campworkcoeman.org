## Pre-Camp Leaders Meeting

Dates of pre-camp planning meetings for 2020 are May 2^nd and May 30^th; both meetings will begin at 1:30 PM in the Dining Hall. Each troop should send their camp Scoutmaster and Senior Patrol Leader to *one* of these meetings. All pre-camp planning information will be discussed related to
programs, medical form requirements, and the Sunday check-in process. All
troops should be represented at one of these meetings. A visit to your campsite is possible with a Camp Commissioner. Please confirm attendance to the Camp Director, Lou Seiser ([lseiser@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:lsesier@campworkcoeman.org)).

## Pre-Camp Troop Activity Sign-up

Your troop should sign up for merit badges and troop activities prior to camp. 
**This will be done 
online using a fillable Google Form for which the appropriate links will be emailed to troop 
contacts following each program planning meeting.**

Merit badge selections should be submitted online at least **three** weeks prior to your 
week at camp. The Program Director will be in contact to verify receipt of selections and work with 
you in regards to any necessary program changes.

Troop activity requests should be submitted online at least **three** weeks prior to your 
week at camp. We will develop a schedule for your troop from the requested activities. Please understand that we will make every effort to schedule your desired troop activities. Some activities are 
in high demand and we want to be fair to everyone.
