## Summer 2021 @ Workcoeman --- Scouting &Agrave; La Carte

The summer 2021 season at Camp Workcoeman will be atypical but nonetheless rewarding. A series of one and two session daytime merit badge classes will be offered mid-week and on weekends for Scouts BSA whereas two weeks of Day Camp will be offered for Cub Scouts. Additionally, overnight unit and family camping will be offered any night throughout the summer. These programs are not designed to replicate a traditional overnight summer camp experience; rather, they are intended to supplement one through a variety of flexible programs.
