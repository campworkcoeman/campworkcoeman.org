Reserve the ranges for .22 caliber rifle, shotgun, or muzzleloader shooting. A
minimum of one certified Range Safety Officer and one certified instructor is
required to shoot. If your unit cannot provide one, the shooting sports
committee will attempt to provide these individuals for a fee. See the
reservation page for details.
