## Discover Scuba

Camp Workcoeman is entering new waters.

In conjunction with [Enfield Scuba and Watersports](http://www.enfieldscuba.com/)
in Enfield, CT, Camp Workcoeman will offer weekly Discover Scuba courses at
camp.

Every Wednesday, PADI certified instructors from Enfield Scuba and Watersports
will come to camp and offer a full Discover Scuba course. The PADI Discover
Scuba Diving program lets you experience the thrill of diving under the
supervision of a PADI Professional in confined conditions. During your
adventure, you'll master some basic concepts and scuba skills and will
experience an open water adventure.

The weekly course is open to Scouts and Scouters age 13 and over and requires
an extra fee of $50 per participant. Anyone interested should sign up early as
space is limited.

All participants must be in generally good health and complete a PADI required
medical history and informed consent form (provided from camp).

## Open Water PADI Scuba Certification

During the third and fifth weeks of Scout camp, instructors from the Enfield Scuba and
Watersports will also offer a full PADI Open Water certification course. The
cost of the full certification course is $550, which includes the course fee
and covers a full week's stay at camp.

Scouts will also work on BSA's Scuba Merit Badge and have the opportunity to
work on additional PADI programs offered by Enfield Scuba and Watersports. In
addition, Scouts can also work on advancement and Merit Badges offered during
the week of camp.

For those Scouts who have already received PADI Open Water Certification,
Enfield Dive instructors will also offer the following Adventure Diving
