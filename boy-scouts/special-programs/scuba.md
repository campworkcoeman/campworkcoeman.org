## Going to the BSA's Florida Sea Base? Get your SCUBA certification at Workcoeman!

Is your unit planning on attending the Florida Sea Base? If so, get your required SCUBA certification while attending a week of Scouts BSA camp at Camp Workcoeman. Located in the scenic hills of northwestern Connecticut, Camp Workcoeman boasts one of the cleanest lakes around---perfect for learning to SCUBA dive locally in New England.

## Discover Scuba

Camp Workcoeman is entering new waters.

In conjunction with outside instructors, Camp Workcoeman will offer weekly Discover Scuba courses at
camp.

Every Wednesday, certified instructors will come to camp and offer a full Discover Scuba course. The Discover
Scuba Diving program lets you experience the thrill of diving under the
supervision of a scuba professional in confined conditions. During your
adventure, you'll master some basic concepts and scuba skills and will
experience an open water adventure.

The weekly course is open to Scouts and Scouters age 13 and over and requires
an extra fee of $50 per participant. Anyone interested should sign up early as
space is limited.

All participants must be in generally good health and complete a required
medical history and informed consent form (provided from camp).

## Open Water Scuba Certification

During the third and fifth weeks of Scout camp, outside instructors
will also offer a full open water certification course. The
cost of the full certification course is $550, which includes the course fee
and covers a full week's stay at camp.

Scouts will also work on BSA's Scuba Merit Badge and have the opportunity to
work on additional scuba programs. In
addition, Scouts can also work on advancement and Merit Badges offered during
the week of camp.

Interested Scouts can sign up using the Connecticut Rivers Council Summer Camp
Registration Form or can contact camp directly.
