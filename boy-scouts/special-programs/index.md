## Scuba

A new challenge for older Scouts who would like to discover the depths of West
Hill Pond. Every week a professional instructor will come to camp to teach
Scouts 13 and older about scuba diving. All participants will have a chance to
spend time under water to see what it is all about. Additionally, a PADI
certification course will be offered during week 3.

## Shawtown Wilderness Trek

The Shawtown Wilderness Trek is a challenging opportunity for older Scouts. It
all happens along Camp Workcoeman's hiking trails, where Scouts will complete a
special task that tests their skills in survival, pioneering, and teamwork. The
trek leads to the Shawtown Wilderness Outpost where all will spend the night
learning about the Shawntown folklore. While there, Scouts will try their hand
at muzzleloading rifles and tomahawk throwing. All Scouts who successfully
complete the program will be awarded a special Wilderness Trek patch reserved
only for them.

## Huck Finn Tube Ride

Your troop can arrange for a tubing trip down the Farmington River through
Satan's Kingdom---a great way to spend a hot summer afternoon! Reservations
must be made in advance at your Tuesday planning meeting. Transportation to and
from the river is up to the troop. An additional fee and a completed parental
permission form is required for all youth participants. As this is considered
an individual troop activity, a Tour Permit must be submitted; this can be done
at the Camp Office. Please visit the
[Farmington River Tubing website](http://www.farmingtonrivertubing.com/) for
more information. A link to the parental waiver is located at the bottom of the
page.
