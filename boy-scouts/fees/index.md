The fees to attend week-long Boy Scout Resident Summer Camp in 2019 are as follows.

### Scout Fees

Early Fee: $425
: A $50 deposit per **named** Scout camper is due no later than **Wednesday March 6, 2019**.
  If paid in full by **May 15, 2019, the fee will be $425**; payments received
  after **May 15, 2019** will be charged a **late fee of $25**, making the total fee
  **$450**.

Regular Fee: $450
: A $50 deposit per **named** Scout added to your camp roster after
  **March 6, 2019**. If paid in full by **May 15, 2019, the fee will be $450**.
  Payments received after **May 15, 2019** will be charged a **late fee of $40**,
  making the total fee **$490**.

### Discounts for Scouts

Encore (2^nd week of camp): $325
: The registration process will require the Scout's other camp/week to be
  identified. To qualify, a Scout must have already spent a week in a
  **Boy Scout Camp or National High Adventure Base**, and the discount applies to a
  second week at one of the Connecticut Rivers Council's camps.

### Adult Scouter Fees

Fees for extra Scouters are calculated at **$20 per day** or **$120 for the full week**. Names of
Scouters are not required until May 15. Two Scouters are free. Additional
Scouters may be free according to the schedule below:

 # of youth per program | # of free Scouters | all additional adults
------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------
  5--10                 | 2                  | $120
 11--20                 | 3                  | $120
 21--30                 | 4                  | $120
 31--40                 | 5                  | $120

### Webelos Crossovers & New Scouts

These Scouts are always afforded the lowest possible camp fee rate. Because
many troops don't know what Webelos will be joining their troop until after the
March 6 deposit date, a special registration category will be established for
them. This will also include any boys who join the troop as new Scouts between
March 6 and the beginning of the troop's week at camp.

### Camperships

The Connecticut Rivers Council will continue to award camperships to assist 
Scouts in need of funds to attend camp who might not otherwise do so. The annual
 campership fund is limited and fluctuates from year to year. Similar to Webelos
 crossovers and new Scouts, campership Scouts will also be afforded the lowest 
possible rate to attend camp. The unit process for paying for these Scouts is to
 be determined.

### Specialty Camp Programs

Registration for all Specialty Camp programs will be accomplished by the
individual. These programs will include Trail to Eagle and various other daily 
or weekend programs.

### Payments

**All** deposits and subsequent payments for camp **must** be made online
through the Connecticut Rivers Council web site.
Payments may be in the form of an E-Check or credit card. There is no charge to
the unit using this method of payment.

### FAQs

Question
: I don't know what Scouts in my troop are going to attend camp by the March
6^th Early Fee deposit date. Why should I make a deposit for the "unknown"?

Answer
: Camp promotion is a year round process. The unit's camp plans should already
  be on the family's calendars. Units also should have a pretty good idea of
  the percentage of Scouts in the troop that attends camp. Register and make
  deposits for that number of **named** Scouts. Deposits may later be
  transferred between Scouts.

<br/>
Question
: We know our troop has Scouts that need Campership assistance in order to
  attend camp. Should we register them with a $50 deposit by March 6^th?

Answer
: Yes, but not necessarily. As stated above, campership applicants are always
  afforded the lowest possible camp fee. Naming them by March 6^th helps the Camp
  Directors in planning for a great summer program.
