  If paid in full by May 15, 2017, the fee will be $405; payments received

### Adult Scouter Fees

Fees for extra Scouters are calculated at $15 per day/$90 per week. Names of
Scouters are not required until May 15. Two Scouters are free. Additional
Scouters may be free according to the schedule below:

 # of youth per program | # of free Scouters | all additional adults
------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------
  5--10                 | 2                  | $90

 31--40                 | 5                  | $90

### Webelos Crossovers & New Scouts

These Scouts are always afforded the lowest possible camp fee rate. Because
many troops don't know what Webelos will be joing their troop until after the
March 1 deposit date, a special registration category will be established for
them. This will also include any boys who join the troop as new Scouts between
March 2 and the beginning of the troop's week at camp. This registration will
be available May 16.

### Camperships

The Connecticut Rivers Council is pleased to offer camperships to Scouts who are members of the Connecticut Rivers Council who attend Connecticut Rivers Council Camp.  Camperships are subject to available funding. Camperships are the equivalent of a school scholarship but for summer camp. They are awarded based upon financial need as determined by the most recent 1040 tax form.  Extenuating circumstances may be considered.   

**Except** on rare occasions, Camperships are **NOT** granted for amounts greater than 50% of the camp fee.  Camperships are awarded for ONE (1) camp session per Scout.  Camperships are not transferrable between Scouts.  Please file a separate application for EACH individual in a household requesting a Campership (however only one tax form is required to be provided to the council per family).  

The deadline for the submissions is April 1^st.  Any Campership applications received after April 1^st (or incomplete campership applications not completed before April 1^st) will be put into a pool for consideration of any remaining funds.

### Specialty Camp Programs

Registration for all Specialty Camp programs will be accomplished by the
individual. These programs will include Trail to Eagle, NRA Shooting Sports,
AdVenture Camp, Robotics & Technology, and various other daily or weekend
programs.

### Payments

**All** deposits and subsequent payments for camp **must** be made online
through your MyCouncil page on the Connecticut Rivers Council web site.
Payments may be in the form of an E-Check or credit card. There is no charge to
the unit using this method of payment.

### FAQs

Question
: I don't know what Scouts in my troop are going to attend camp by the March
1^st Early Fee deposit date. Why should I make a deposit for the "unknown"?

Answer
: Camp promotion is a year round process. The unit's camp plans should already
  be on the family's calendars. Units also should have a pretty good idea of
  the percentage of Scouts in the troop that attends camp. Register and make
  deposits for that number of **named** Scouts. Deposits may later be
  transferred between Scouts.

<br/>
Question
: We know our troop has Scouts that need Campership assistance in order to
  attend camp. Should we register them with a $50 deposit by March 1^st?

Answer
: Yes, but not necessarily. As stated above, campership applicants are always
  afforded the lowest possible camp fee. Naming them by March 2 helps the Camp
  Directors in planning for a great summer program.
