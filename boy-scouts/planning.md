  arrival.

## Pre-Camp Troop Activity Sign-up

Troop leaders have the option of submitting your desired troop activity list
prior to your pre-camp planning meeting. Just send a list of those troop
activities that your troop would like to have in their camp schedule and we
will develop a schedule to meet your needs. Please submit this activity list
*three* weeks prior to your week at camp. We will have a schedule for you to
review at your planning meeting. You will have the opportunity to make changes
at this time. Please understand that we will make every effort to schedule your
desired activities, and submitting your list does not guarantee your list is
official. Some activities are in high demand and we want to be fair to
everyone.
