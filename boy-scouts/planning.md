## Pre-Camp Leaders Meeting

Two pre-camp planning meetings will be scheduled for May; dates TBD. All pre-camp planning information will be discussed related to
programs, medical form requirements, and the Sunday check-in process. All
troops should be represented at one of these meetings.

### Medical Forms

Medical Forms should be sent to camp two weeks prior to your arrival. You will
be contacted by the Camp Health Officer if additional medical information is
needed. Please do not fax your medical forms to camp.

### Scout Arrival Times

Scout arrival time is Sunday at 2:00 p.m. All Scouts should go directly to your
campsite.

### Health Officer Check-In

Your troop will be assigned a time for your Sunday check-in with the Health
Officers. Please do not check-in with the Health Officers until your assigned
time.

### Photo and BBQ Payments

Troop photo payments and BBQ reservations are due Tuesday morning. Please use
the appropriate forms found in the program guide.

## Things to Remember

* Troop photos are taken Tuesday during lunch.
* The Court of Honor is Saturday at 10:00 a.m.
* The family BBQ is immediately following the Court of Honor
* If your troop's leadership will change during the week, a roster indicating
  leader names and arrival and departure times must be submitted at your Sunday
  arrival.

## Pre-Camp Troop Activity Sign-up

Troop leaders have the option of submitting your desired troop activity list
prior to your pre-camp planning meeting. Just send a list of those troop
activities that your troop would like to have in their camp schedule and we
will develop a schedule to meet your needs. Please submit this activity list
*three* weeks prior to your week at camp. We will have a schedule for you to
review at your planning meeting. You will have the opportunity to make changes
at this time. Please understand that we will make every effort to schedule your
desired activities, and submitting your list does not guarantee your list is
official. Some activities are in high demand and we want to be fair to
everyone.
