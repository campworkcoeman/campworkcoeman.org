## Conservation Camp --- July 21--27, 2019

The goal of the week is to prepare participants to develop and
complete a significant conservation project towards earning the Hornaday Badge.

development and planning skills, create a plan to lead and carry out significant
conservation work, team building and training skills, and understand what is
required to complete Hornaday awards. Participants will be guided through
necessary procedures and work needing to be done outside the week at camp in
order to complete the Hornaday Badge. Participants will be matched with
Conservation Advisors to help plan and carry out the project. Merit badge
activities may include Environmental Science, Fish and Wildlife Management, Soil
and Water Conservation, Forestry, and others from the required merit badge list.
