A brief overview and schedule of summer 2024 programs at Camp Workcoeman is provided below; additional information and registration links will be posted in the coming months.
</div>

**Goal**: To provide summer Scouting opportunities for Scouts and units that either augments a traditional summer program or provides opportunities for those who are unable to participate in the traditional program.


Building on the success of the past few seasons, Camp Workcoeman will continue to offer a variety of short-term opportunities for both Scouts BSA and Cub Scout participants throughout the summer of 2024. This includes day and family camp for Cub Scouts and one and two day merit badges, a la carte activities/rentals, scuba certification, and National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) for Scouts BSA. In addition, overnight unit and family camping is available all summer.
