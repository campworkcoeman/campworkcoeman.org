This popular event continues in 2025 and is open to all Webelos, Arrow of Light Scouts, Den Chiefs, and their leaders and parents. The program combines learning and fun, during a program where den leaders can pre-select badges and activities their Scouts can work towards during the weekend. In addition to activity badge opportunities, Scouts will have the opportunity to participate in range and target activities, climbing, an enjoyable special program, and a campwide campfire on Saturday evening.

Meals will be provided from Saturday breakfast through Sunday breakfast. Following registration, unit leadership will be emailed a link to a form to register their den for adventure badges.

A pre-camp meeting for leaders and parents will be held September 9^th to communicate information and answer any questions.
