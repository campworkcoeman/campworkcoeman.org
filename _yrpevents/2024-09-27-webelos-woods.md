Webelos Woods is an action-packed event designed to acquaint Webelos and Arrow of Light
Scouts with Scouting at the Troop level and assist them in completing adventure badges related
to both these ranks and the outdoors.

Meals will be provided from Saturday breakfast through Sunday breakfast. Following
registration, unit leadership will be emailed a link to a form to register their den for adventure
badges.

A pre-camp meeting for leaders and parents will be held in early September to communicate
information and answer any questions.
