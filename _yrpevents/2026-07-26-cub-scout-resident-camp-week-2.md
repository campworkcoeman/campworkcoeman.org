Get ready for the ultimate Cub Scout camping experience at Camp Workcoeman in the summer of 2026! Scouts will discover adventure, friendship, and the great outdoors during our Cub Scout Resident Camp and Mini Week programs---all built around the exciting theme, Dinosaurs!

Cub Scouts and their leaders will spend a full week living the adventure at one of the oldest continuously operated Scout camps in the country. Days are filled with swimming, boating, archery, BB shooting, crafts, nature exploration, STEM activities, and campfire programs. Evenings bring songs, laughter, and the unforgettable spirit of Scouting around the campfire. Resident Camp is the perfect opportunity for Scouts to build confidence, learn new skills, earn adventure pins and belt loops, and make lasting friendships.
