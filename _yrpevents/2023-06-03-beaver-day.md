This very important day will bring Scouters together from all over the council to do the important task of preparing Camp Workcoeman for the summer camp season and beyond.

Various projects are planned and we need your help!

We will gather at 8:30 to review projects and begin work thereafter. Lunch will be provided.

Time: 8:30 AM -- 4:30 PM
