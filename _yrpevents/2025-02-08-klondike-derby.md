The Charter Oak District Klondike Derby is a “traditional” derby, tests all the skills a Scout is learning, and is unique in Connecticut. The purpose of the Klondike Derby is to develop patrol teamwork through an intensive orienteering and camping competition. Patrols pull Alaskan type sledges containing all their equipment to stations or “town” located in the woods. The patrols are required to plot course headings and directions to locate specific towns in a given order. They must then choose how best to get to them. Patrols will earn points based on total elapsed course time a patrol requires to reach five Klondike towns (stations), and the total number of nuggets awarded to the patrol by the mayor of each town for skills demonstrated.

We will run both a day and overnight course this year. The day course is a one-day event for patrols without winter tent camping experience and those patrols with fewer map and compass skills. The overnight course is for patrols experienced in orienteering skills and familiar with winter tent camping.

Webelos dens are invited to participate in the Day Course. Webelos cannot compete or be placed in Scouts BSA patrols.

See the Troop Leader Guide (below) for full event details (including information on the *required* preparation meeting and optional meetings).

Time: Starting times will be 8:30, 9:00, 9:30 and 10:00 AM on Saturday. The Day Course finishes at 3:30 PM on Saturday while the Overnight Course ends at 11:30 AM on Sunday.

Fee: $20 per Scout
