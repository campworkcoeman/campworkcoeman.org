Come out for a weekend of wild west fun and adventure at Camp Workcoeman! This event includes two nights of camping; three meals on Saturday in the dining hall; and a day of skill development, teamwork, and fun. Participants will also receive a commemorative patch.

Packs and dens are encouraged to bring a wagon that will carry their gear to different stations throughout the day. Scouts are also encouraged to get into the ‘wild west’ spirit by wearing cowboy hats, neckerchiefs, and more!

A detailed program guide will be distributed prior to the event that will contain information about a pre-camp meeting, items to bring, and a schedule for the event.

Check-in starts at 6:00 PM Friday, with departure at 9:00 AM Sunday.

Registration closes Monday, April 20, 2026 at 11:59 PM.
