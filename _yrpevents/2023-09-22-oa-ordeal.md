Induction weekends are the largest lodge events of the year.  During these weekends, we welcome new members into the Order of the Arrow, provide much-needed service to the camps, and gather with our current members for Fun and Fellowship.
 
The purpose of the Ordeal is to have candidates reflect on their own Scout life and character and come to a deeper understanding of the Scout Oath and the Order's principles. This purpose is realized through a fourfold Ordeal that includes sleeping alone, silence, work, and a limited amount of food. No hazing or endangerment of a Scout's safety is allowed.

Time: 8:00 AM -- 12:00 noon

OA Candidate Cost: $60 (covers 2023 dues, sash, book, Lodge flap, and all meals & fun for the weekend.)

Current Brother of the Lodge/Brotherhood Candidate Cost:<br>

- Adult: $20 (covers all meals and fun for the weekend)<br>
- Youth: $10 (covers all meals and fun for the weekend)<br>
- 2023 Tschitani Ticketholder: $0 (covered by Ticket, but you MUST register)
