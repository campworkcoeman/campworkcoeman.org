NRA Rifle or Shotgun Instructor training is being offered this fall at Camp Workcoeman in an effort to offer safe and challenging shooting sports activities at our camps. Scouters with an interest in becoming part of a council shooting sports team can become certified as an NRA Rifle or Shotgun Instructor. 

Becoming a certified NRA Instructor in Rifle or Shotgun requires a three step process:

3. NRA Rifle or Shotgun Instructor Training

NRA Shotgun Instructor Training runs Saturday, November 5, 2022 8:00 AM -- 6:00 PM. The fee is $150, which covers instruction charts, manuels, notebooks, ammunition, targets, and lunch.
