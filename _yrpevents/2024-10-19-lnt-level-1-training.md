The Leave No Trace Level 1 Course is a two-day program that teaches the ideals and practices of Outdoor Ethics. Youth and adult participants will learn about the seven principles of Leave No Trace and the skills necessary to implement these ethics while in the outdoors. The course also includes basic teaching techniques and, as such, will help a scout to serve as an Outdoor Ethics Guide. Participants should be prepared for a short backpacking trek, and a brief presentation on a Leave No Trace topic.

In addition to weather-appropriate attire, all participants must bring a copy of Parts A & B of the Scout medical form.

Time: October 19 8:00 AM -- October 20 4:30 PM

Scout Cost: $25

Adult Cost: $25
