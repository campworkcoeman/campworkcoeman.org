Begin the Workcoeman Centennial with a hike that goes back more than 200 years.  Visit the remains of 19^th century homesteads, see evidence of the charcoal industry, and enjoy a view over West Hill Pond and across to the Metacomet Ridge.  Participants should be prepared for a vigorous winter hike of about five miles and come dressed in weather-appropriate layers.  In addition to the Scout basic essentials, participants should bring a backpack, a warm lunch in a thermos, a wag bag, and winter traction.  Snowshoes may be required in the case of a particularly heavy snow load.

Gather for this hike at the camp chapel by the parking lot at 8:00 AM; come prepared to hike five miles and pack a trail snack. The hike will end early afternoon.

Cost: Free (but please register)
