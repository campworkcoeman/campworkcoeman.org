See the Scouts BSA [Scuba]({{ site.url }}/scouts-bsa/special-programs/scuba/) page for an overview of all scuba programs.

This entry level SCUBA Certification course is designed to give participants the qualifications and skills necessary to safely conduct open water dives. Participants will learn about buoyancy, applying weights, marine conservation, equipment, and more. There will also be an online training section that participants must complete before the onsite training at camp. Details will be sent to all who register. This program includes meals from Monday lunch through Thursday lunch and overnight camping. It also includes all instruction, equipment, and certification.

Participants will be contacted by the [Connecticut Scuba Academy](https://ctscuba.org/) beforehand with information on medical forms, pre-learning, and more. Participants can either come for the day or stay overnight; evening activities will be available for those staying overnight.

Time: 8:00 AM -- 5:00 PM each day

Cost: $450 per participant
