This program incorporates hiking and orienteering requirements for Tenderfoot and Second Class Ranks---focusing mostly on the Five Mile Hike requirement and those related to it (safe hiking, use of a compass, identifying animals, etc.). Scouts will be provided with lunch, materials, and experienced counselors who will make this experience a success.

Scouts must come prepared with good hiking shoes, be dressed appropriately, and have a day pack with a filled water bottle and space to carry their lunch.

Check-in starts at 8:30 AM, with closing at 4:00 PM. Lunch will be provided.
 
Cost: $25 per Scout
