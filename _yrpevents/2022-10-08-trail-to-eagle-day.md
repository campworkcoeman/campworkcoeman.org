This Program is meant to provide Scouts with the opportunity to earn at least a portion of a merit badge that is required to become an Eagle Scout.  In addition to the merit badge class, there will also be a session where Scouts are taught about the Eagle Scout requirements, including the Eagle Service Project and, most importantly, leadership. 

Merit badges offered include: Citizenship in the Nation, Citizenship in the World, Emergency Preparedness, First Aid, and Hiking.
