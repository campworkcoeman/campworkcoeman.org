Get ready for a week of outdoor fun, friendship, and discovery at Cub Scout Day Camp 2026 at Camp Workcoeman! Designed for Cub Scouts entering grades 1--5, this exciting daytime program lets Scouts experience the best of camp life---all while returning home each evening.

Each day, campers will explore new adventures across Workcoeman’s beautiful lakeside setting, including archery, BB shooting, nature exploration, crafts, swimming, and team games. They’ll take part in STEM activities, campfire songs, and theme-based challenges — all led by trained and enthusiastic staff who bring Scouting’s values to life.

With a new theme every year, 2026’s “Dinosaurs” will encourage Scouts to chart their own path of discovery, learning new skills, and creating memories that last a lifetime.

Join the adventure---where every day is packed with fun, friendship, and the spirit of Scouting!
