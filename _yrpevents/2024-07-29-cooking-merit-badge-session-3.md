See the Scouts BSA [Summer Programs]({{ site.url }}/scouts-bsa/summer-programs/) page for more information.

The Cooking merit badge introduces principles of cooking that can be used both at home or in the outdoors. Through taking this merit badge, Scouts will learn about food safety, nutritional guidelines, meal planning, and methods of food preparation and will review the variety of culinary (or cooking) careers available.

While at camp for these three days, Scouts will complete the 'Camp Cooking' and 'Trail Cooking' components of this merit badge. To earn a completion, they will need to email their menu and photos of them cooking to the camp staff. There will also be a Zoom meeting on the Tuesday evening of the week prior to this merit badge---all participants will be required to attend this Zoom meeting.

Please note the classes run each day from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. Units can coordinate an overnight stay, with food and program options; a campsite must be reserved separately. Scouts may not, however, stay overnight unattended without parent or unit supervision.

Recommended for Second Class Scouts and above.

Time: 8:30 AM -- 4:30 PM each day

Scout Cost: $100 per Scout
