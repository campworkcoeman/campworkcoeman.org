A COPE & Climbing Train the Trainer Event.

This weekend course is aimed to provide training and education for COPE & Climbing Directors and Instructors to facilitate COPE & Climbing programs for Scouts and Scouters with disabilities. Whether the disabilities are physical, behavioral or emotional, the course will provide students with tools and understanding to provide the best experience for C & C participants. The course will cover topics such as autism, sight and hearing disabilities, lack of limb use and many other disabilities our participants may experience. For practical skills students will learn various haul systems, trolley systems, and aid systems that will provide our participants the ability to complete our programs while still challenging them.

All equipment will be provided, students may use their own helmets and harnesses if approved by course instructors.

Time: November 1 7:00 PM -- November 3 2:00 PM

Adult Cost: $50
