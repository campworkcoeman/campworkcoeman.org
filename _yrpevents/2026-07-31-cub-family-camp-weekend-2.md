Experience the magic of Camp Workcoeman together during Family Camp! This special weekend program invites Scouting families of all ages to enjoy the beauty and excitement of camp life---without the need to pack up the whole den.

Spend the weekend camping outdoors, swimming in the crystal-clear lake, testing your aim at archery and BB ranges, exploring nature trails, and joining in crafts, games, and campfire programs. Whether you prefer swimming, boating, sports, or something else, Camp Workcoeman offers a perfect setting for families to connect, unwind, and make lasting memories.

Enjoy great meals in the dining hall, friendly staff-led activities, and plenty of free time to relax or explore with your family. Family Camp is the perfect blend of fun, fellowship, and outdoor adventure---a true celebration of Scouting and family togetherness.

Join us this summer and make Camp Workcoeman your family’s favorite tradition!

Time: 6:00 PM Friday through 10:00 AM Sunday
