This program is designed to enable Cub Scout and Webelos to learn and practice outdoor skills related to their rank requirements during a competition with other dens and packs from the surrounding area.
 
This event is themed after the ‘Wild West,’ where each den is encouraged to bring a wagon to carry supplies needed for each activity. In addition to the derby itself, this weekend program will include two nights of camping; breakfast, lunch, and dinner on Saturday; a Saturday night campfire; and a ‘Special Program.’ A program guide is available below, and a commemorative patch will be presented to all Scouts in attendance.
 
Check-in starts at 6:00 PM Friday, with departure at 9:00 AM Sunday.

Registration closes at 11:59 PM on Tuesday, April 23, 2024.
 
Cost: $35 per Scout, $15 per adult
