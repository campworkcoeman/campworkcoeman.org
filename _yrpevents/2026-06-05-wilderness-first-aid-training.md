Wilderness first aid is a training course that focuses on prevention, assessment, and treatment for an ill or injured person in a remote environment where definitive care by a physician and/or rapid transport is not readily available.

WFA prepares participants to identify and address medical issues that can arise in the backcountry. Treatment skills are taught as well as educating adults to recognize illnesses early and minimize the potential for injury. The skills learned in this WFA course can save lives.

WFA is not just for the backcountry. It is just as relevant in urban areas during hurricanes, floods, fires, or mass casualty events when emergency services might be strained. WFA knowledge can be lifesaving.

*Prerequisite:* There is an online portion that must be completed prior to arrival. Participants can complete this in phases as they have time; online training information will be emailed well in advance and will take approximately eight hours to complete.

The list of WFA training options available on this weekend will consist of:

- **Wilderness First Aid Certification**: $300 (participant is already certified in CPR)
- **Wilderness First Aid Certification and Red Cross CPR Certification**: $325
- **Red Cross CPR Only Certification**: $25<br>Takes place 6:00--10:00 PM Friday evening only.
- **Wilderness First Aid Trainer Certification**: $300<br>Participants must have Wilderness First Aid and CPR certifications valid through at least June 15, 2026; they must register by March 31, 2026 and be prepared to meet with instructors beforehand via Zoom.


Participants are required to stay at camp for the duration of the course. Meals provided include a Friday evening cracker barrel as well as breakfast and lunch on Saturday. Arrival is 6:00 PM on Friday, and departure is 6:00 PM on Saturday.
