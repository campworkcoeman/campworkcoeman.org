The Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills (IOLS) course provides Scouters
with the confidence to take youth into the outdoors. Specifically, this hands-on program
gives adult leaders a practical introduction to the patrol method of a Scout-led troop by
teaching many of the practical outdoor skills they need to lead Scouts in the outdoors. In
addition, the teaching methods, activities, and games model the variety of teaching
used in effective and engaging Scouting programs.
Upon registering Scouters will receive an email listing the gear and uniform
requirements for the course. No prerequisites are required to participate. Friday evening
arrival is possible, please communicate with the course director if needed.

Time: September 7 8:00 AM -- September 8 11:00 AM

Adult Cost: $40
