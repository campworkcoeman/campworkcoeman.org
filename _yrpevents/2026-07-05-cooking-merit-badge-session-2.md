See the Scouts BSA [Summer Programs]({{ site.url }}/scouts-bsa/summer-programs/) page for more information.

This is a half-week Scouting experience where Scouts will focus on earning the Cooking merit badge---one of the more involved merit badges required to become an Eagle Scout. The Cooking merit badge introduces principles of cooking that can be used both at home or in the outdoors. Through taking this merit badge, Scouts will learn about food safety, nutritional guidelines, meal planning, and methods of food preparation and will review the variety of culinary (or cooking) careers available.

While at camp for these three days, Scouts will complete the ‘Camp Cooking’ and ‘Trail Cooking’ components of this merit badge. To earn a completion, they will need to email their menu and photos of them cooking at home to the camp staff. There will also be a Zoom Meeting on the Tuesday evening of the week prior to this merit badge---all participants will be required to attend this Zoom meeting.

Please note that this overnight experience will include all meals (most of which the Scouts will be cooking), camping in the traditional camp tents, and activities such as swimming, boating, and range activities available outside of when the Scouts will be cooking.

Provisional Scoutmasters have been arranged and will provide onsite supervision. Therefore, Scouts may attend with or without a unit leader or parent; these Scouters, however, are more than welcome.

Recommended for Second Class Scouts and above.

Time: 7:00 PM Sunday -- 7:00 PM Wednesday

Scout Cost: $170 per Scout

Adult Cost: $70 per adult
