NRA Rifle or Shotgun Instructor training is being offered this fall at Camp Workcoeman in an effort to offer safe and challenging shooting sports activities at our camps. Scouters with an interest in becoming part of a council shooting sports team can become certified as an NRA Rifle or Shotgun Instructor. 

Becoming a certified NRA Instructor in Rifle or Shotgun requires a three step process:

1. Basic Rifle or Shotgun Course
2. Basic Instructor Training (BIT)
3. NRA Rifle or Shotgun Instructor Training

Operating a shooting range in Connecticut Rivers Council requires an NRA Instructor and a Range Safety Officer (RSO).

Anyone with interest in shooting sports is eligible to become a RSO. This training is not required to become a rifle or shotgun instructor and does not have a shooting component in the training. 

Range Safety Officer (RSO) Training runs Saturday, January 21, 2023 8:00 AM -- 5:00 PM. The fee is $100. The snow date is January 28, 2023.
