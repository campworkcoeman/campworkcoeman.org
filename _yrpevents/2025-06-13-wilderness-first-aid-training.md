Wilderness first aid is a training course that focuses on prevention, assessment, and treatment for an ill or injured person in a remote environment where definitive care by a physician and/or rapid transport is not readily available.

WFA prepares participants to identify and address medical issues that can arise in the backcountry. Treatment skills are taught as well as educating adults to recognize illnesses early and minimize the potential for injury. The skills learned in this WFA course can save lives.

WFA is not just for the backcountry. It is just as relevant in urban areas during hurricanes, floods, fires, or mass casualty events when emergency services might be strained. WFA knowledge can be lifesaving.

CPR certification is a prerequisite for all participants. CPR certification will be conducted on Friday evening, June 7 at 6:00 PM for those not certified.

The list of WFA training options available on this weekend will consist of:

- **Wilderness First Aid Certification**: $300 (participant is already certified in CPR)<br>Arrive Friday night at 5:30--6:00 PM or Saturday morning at 7:30 AM for 8:00 AM Saturday start.
- **Wilderness First Aid Certification and CPR Certification**: $325<br>Arrive Friday 5:30--6:00 PM.
- **Red Cross CPR Only Certification**: $25<br>Takes place 6:00--10:00 PM Friday evening only.


Participants are required to stay at camp for the duration of the course. Meals provided include breakfast, lunch, and dinner on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday. Departure is 1:00 PM on Sunday.
