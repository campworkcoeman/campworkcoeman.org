Scouts will have the opportunity to finish any incomplete 'partial' merit badges during this program at Camp Workcoeman. Scouts must list the badges they would like to work on when registering. Please know that merit badges appropriate for a camp setting in late summer are appropriate for this program. Contact [Jeff Seiser](mailto:jseiser@campworkcoeman.org) should you have any questions on whether a merit badge can be worked on as part of this program. This is a morning program only, concluding at 12:00 noon. No meals are provided.

Time: September 6, 8:30 AM -- 12:00 Noon

Scout Cost: $20
