Get ready for the ultimate Cub Scout camping experience at Camp Workcoeman in the summer of 2026! Scouts will discover adventure, friendship, and the great outdoors during our Cub Scout Resident Camp and Mini Week programs---all built around the exciting theme, Dinosaurs!

For Scouts newer to camping, Mini Week offers a shorter three-day, two-night introduction to the Cub Scout Resident Camp experience. It’s a great way to get a taste of all the fun—outdoor adventures, camp activities, and quality time with fellow Scouts---packed into a perfectly sized adventure.

Come join us this summer and map your adventure at Camp Workcoeman---where every day brings new experiences, new friends, and lifelong memories!
