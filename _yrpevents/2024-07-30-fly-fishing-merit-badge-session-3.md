Fly-fishing is a specialized form of fishing that combines skill and artistry. Because it is so rich with tradition, it is a passion for millions of people. The beauty of the water, the solitude, and the skills that the sport requires have made fly-fishing very important in the lives of many notable people. Come out to camp to take part in this badge this summer.

Scouts will participate in Fly Fishing Merit Badge, which includes learning how to cast, tie flies, gut and cook a fish, and much more. Program includes lunch and equipment.
