The summer 2021 season at Camp Workcoeman will be atypical but nonetheless rewarding. A series of one and two session daytime merit badge classes will be offered mid-week and on weekends for Scouts BSA whereas two weeks of Day Camp will be offered for Cub Scouts. Additionally, overnight unit and family camping will be offered any night throughout the summer. These programs are not designed to replicate a traditional overnight summer camp experience; rather, they are intended to supplement one through a variety of flexible programs.

## COVID Safety

We know the importance of getting youth outdoors and involved in the programs of Adventure.  We are taking every step to ensure that this summer will be SAFE and FUN!  Camp will be awesome this summer, but it will look a little different than what we are used to.  We have instituted protocols and procedures in order to keep our Scouts, Scouters, staff, and families healthy and safe.  The procedures and safety measures have been promoted by federal agencies and the American Camping Association Field Guide for Camps. These multi-layered strategies prove effective and reduce the risk of transmission. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/33wn554u">Learn more</a> about specific COVID guidelines.
