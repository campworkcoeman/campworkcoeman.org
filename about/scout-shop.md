The Camp Workcoeman Trading Post hours vary throughout the year. For July and August, we'll be open Saturdays 9:00 AM -- 5:00 PM and by appointment (email [scoutshop@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:scoutshop@campworkcoeman.org)).

The trading post is a satellite Scout Shop, offering uniform parts and patches, as well as advancement items! While we don't stock everything, we can order it for you, and purchases can be charged directly to unit accounts. Unit leaders looking to obtain advancement items such as merit badges, rank patches, Eagle memorabilia, or Cub Scout belt loops/pins are encouraged to pre-order items with us so that we can ensure we have everything you need!  Pre-orders, or inquiries of any kind, can be submitted directly to [scoutshop@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:scoutshop@campworkcoeman.org).
