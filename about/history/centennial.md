<p>Camp Workcoeman has a number of activities planned for 2024 to celebrate its centennial. Throughout our centennial, there will be a variety of ways we will mark the passion, the friendships, and the experiences that have made and continue to make Camp Workcoeman a truly special place. We will also use this opportunity to look ahead to the next century of Scouting at Workcoeman and to how we will continue to evolve while maintaining the same mission to good Scouting that makes Workcoeman the place it is.</p>

<p>This year-long celebration will include merchandise, patch sets, historical tributes, and a series of special events featuring something for everyone associated with our camp---Scouts, units, adults, and alumni. As you plan your calendar for 2024, please keep in mind these events and make it a point to visit Camp Workcoeman both to celebrate our amazing past and to look ahead to our bright future.</p>
