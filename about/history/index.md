## The Founding of Camp Workcoeman
#### As Recalled by Scouter Seymour Weeks in 1960

Way back in 1921 we didn't have the "Class A" camp we do today. As a matter of
fact, our second class council didn't have any camp at all. That year, two long
hikes had been planned. The first, to take a week, was over to Newgate Prison,
an old pre-revolutionary gaol. The other, to last two weeks, was north to
Canaan, down the Housatonic River to New Milford, and then home, making a good
sixty miles in all. While we were on this second hike a number of us had a
chance encounter with poison ivy.

Rather than hiking under this hardship, our leader, Mr. Copley, a part time
photographer and Chief Scout Executive, decided to lay over a while at Bantam
Lake, since we were ahead of schedule. He found a good spot, and we camped near
Mr. Frank Coe's cottage. Mr. Coe watched us and he was, if I might say so,
rather impressed by the way we conduced ourselves.

Several weeks later at a meeting of some Scout Leaders, Mr. Coe brought up the
matter of a permanent Scout camp. He asked Mr. Copley and Captain Geer to
inspect sites for a camp. However, no suitable area on Bantam Lake could be
found. Mr. Fred Baldwin a local real-estate agent, was contacted, and he
happened to own about fifty acres of land on West Hill Pond, and he offered to
sell them.

It was Mr. Coe's intention to present the tract of land in memory of his mother
Mrs. Workman. The council would receive the title to the land as soon as it
became evident its success was certain. However, Mr. Coe died the same month he
purchased the land. For four successive summers the camp had grown constantly
in popularity, and Mrs. Coe, realizing the camp's success was assured,
presented the camp to the Council in December, 1927.

The early development of Camp Workcoeman was done by volunteers. Areas were
cleared for camping and several trails were blazed in the back woods. Cooking
was done on an old Army field range under a tarp. The Council was given an old
wood choppers shack which some of us tore down and used the timber from to
build a supply shack on the site of the present mess hall. Some time later,
lumber was donated, and a small dining hall was constructed.

More buildings were built, the water front improved, camp facilities
constructed, all because of the land and donations of time and money. Because
of all this, Tunxis Council now possesses one of the finest camps in the
country. In the early years, a few dozen boys could attend camp. Today it is
possible for six hundred forty scouts to come to Camp Workcoeman every summer.
If it wasn't for that poison ivy so many years ago, perhaps none of this would
be possible.



## Continued Growth

Still the growth of Camp Workcoeman continued, and in 1968--1970 the Tunxis
Council conducted another capital campaign. This campaign provided for the
construction of a new council office on Kennedy Drive, added a full time camp
ranger at Camp Workcoeman, and funded the purchase of additional property
expanding the camp to its current 427 acres.

Other major development projects that added to Camp Workcoeman are the
expansion of the dining hall and construction of meeting rooms in 1994 and the
construction of a new shower facility. This new shower building was a donation
of the Konover Construction Co. in 1996.

For {% camp_years %} years, Camp Workcoeman has provided a opportunity for
Scouts to receive an invaluable Scouting experience.
