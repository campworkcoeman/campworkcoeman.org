Early on a warm July morning, about twenty Torrington Council Scouts made their
way to Camp Workcoeman. While some may have been dropped off on West Hill Road,
most of the boys took the Torrington-Winsted Trolley line. After getting
dropped off near what is now Pinewoods Road, the boys walked north to West Hill
Road, a mile along that, and finally another mile up the old logging road into
camp. The boys may have traveled with fellow Scouts, but they did not function
in their usual troops. Instead, when the Scouts arrived at camp, they settled
into one of the four camper tents, and those tent mates formed the patrol they
worked in for remainder of their stay.

The hike up to camp was not the end of the walking at Camp Workcoeman. While
each tent had its own washbasin, the camp itself had no potable water source.
The Scouts hiked a little over a quarter of a mile to a spring and hauled cans
of water back to camp. The primitive nature of the camp and the necessary
details of the first season kept the Scouts busy. In addition to the customary
scoutcraft activities, the boys spent much of their time building trails
through the property and clearing the area around the waterfront. These sorts
of programs and the name Workcoeman may have given an impression of drudgery;
however, an exchange in *The Torrington Register* offers a boy's perspective of
these pioneer type activities:

> "Gee, it's great!"
> 
> "What's great?"
> 
> "Why, Camp Workcoeman!"
> 
> "But I thought that it was all work."
> 
> "Work? Nothing but to get up an appetite."
> 
> "Eats? Oh yes, Piles on piles of them."

The highlight of the program for most boys was West Hill Pond. With Chief
Beebe's experience and the staff's training, camp program revolved around daily
aquatics. Many of the Scouts who arrived on 14 July were prepared for a
two-week stay, but more Scouts arrived every few days. To accommodate, the boys
set up three more tents. Indeed, word of Camp Workcoeman brought new Scouts
into Torrington's troops.

At the end of July, Workcoeman adjourned for two weeks. Now that Chief Beebe
and the members of the Torrington Council had a little experience, they began
to think long term. During the intersession, Beebe, along with Seymour Weeks
and Ralph Fox, visited nine Scout camps, and fresh with ideas, they returned to
open Workcoeman for two weeklong sessions. The first season ended with a flag
ceremony on the evening of 31 August 1924.
