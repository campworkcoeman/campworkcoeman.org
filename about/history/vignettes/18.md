As the Great Depression dragged on through the months of 1933, the Northern
Litchfield County Council continued to grow. With work hard to find for most
men, boys no longer were able to hold part time positions, or find summer jobs
as farm hands. While this left more time for Scouting, it also made it more
difficult to pay for a week of summer camp. Since the council was also strapped
for cash, it only opened Workcoeman for four weeks in 1933. In view of the fact
that the number of Scouts in the council had increase by fifty percent over
1929, each week ran at full capacity. While the council advertised the record
weekly attendances, the reality was that the Dining Hall was crowded.

As people adjusted to job sharing under the National Recovery Administration,
citizens who held onto jobs found more time on their hands, some of which they
spent as Scouters. The Northern Litchfield County Council received accolades
for having the highest level of volunteer participation in New England. A
possible side product of this increased volunteer time was a camp song,
composed by Amy MacNeil. MacNeil was the mother of a Troop 23 Scout and the
wife of the Troop's Assistant Scoutmaster, both Harry MacNeil. The song,
"Camp Workcoeman," is sung to the tune of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic."
The words describe Workcoeman as a good old camp, already in its tenth season.
MacNeil also chose to honor the camp's standards, which may refer to flags, but
more likely recall the high bar set for Workcoeman's program.

> From the hillside and the valley, from the farm and city too;
> 
> Come our boys to old Workcoeman, Scouts that are so fine and true;
> 
> And they welcome each new buddy with a handclasp and a smile;
> 
> At good old Workcoeman.
