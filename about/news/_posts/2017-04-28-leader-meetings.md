title: Leader Orientation Meetings
---

Summer is fast approaching. To make sure you and your troop are prepared, we ask that each troop sends a representative to one of our leader orientation meetings. We will discuss information on new merit badges, program opportunities, medical form preparations, and everything you need to know for planning your troop's summer camp experience.

Meetings will be held in the Camp Workcoeman Dining Hall on May 6^th and 20^th beginning at 1:30 PM. An additional meeting for Long Island troops will be held May 13^th beginning at 10 AM in the Notre Dame Parish Rectory (45 Mayfair Rd, New Hyde Park, NY 11040). It is only necessary to attend one of these meetings.
