title: Camp Trading Post is Now a Satellite Scout Shop
---

If you had a chance to visit the Camp Workcoeman trading post this past summer, you may have noticed something different --- we are now a satellite Scout Shop, offering uniform parts and patches, as well as Advancement items!

As part of our effort to provide great customer service to our scouting families and local units, we will have regularly scheduled hours throughout the year.  Beginning after Labor Day, we will be open on Wednesdays from 3:00 - 7:00 PM, and on Saturdays from 12:00 - 4:00 PM.

Unit leaders looking to obtain advancement items such as merit badges, rank patches, Eagle memorabilia, or Cub Scout belt loops/pins are encouraged to pre-order items with us so that we can ensure we have everything you need!  Pre-orders, or inquiries of any kind, can be submitted directly to [scoutshop@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:scoutshop@campworkcoeman.org).

We look forward to seeing you at Camp Workcoeman throughout the year!
