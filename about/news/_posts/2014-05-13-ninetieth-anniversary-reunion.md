Camp Workcoeman's ninetieth anniversary reunion will be held on Saturday, July
26, 2014 starting at 3:00pm. Reconnect with generations of Scouters to
celebrate ninety years of good camping on West Hill Pond. Take some time to
tour camp and note the many changes that have occurred over the years before
joining us for a chicken cookout. Whether you were a camper, staffer, or
volunteer you will enjoy this opportunity to reunite with your past.
