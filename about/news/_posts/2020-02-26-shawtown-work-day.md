title: Citizens of Shawtown Work Day a Success
---

Many members of the Citizens of Shawtown gathered at a recent workday at Camp Workcoeman to tackle several projects in preparation for the spring season at camp. One work party completed the final installation of the roof on our new Pole Barn next to the Ranger's Maintenance Building and installed a temporary cover on the entrance of this all important new addition to camp. Simultaneously, the second work party mixed concrete, pouring it into multiple forms that will eventually become the bases for a new Pavilion and the first of many new benches that will be constructed this Spring at Workcoeman! It was a great day as temperatures soared above 40 degrees!

Join us for our next workday at camp on Saturday, March 21^st. There's lots to do assisting Ranger Frank in his daily efforts to keep our camp in top shape for 2020. Please join us for coffee and donuts at 8:30 AM with work commencing at 9:00 AM. Lunch will be provided. Please confirm attendance to either [Ranger Frank](mailto:rangerfrank@campworkcoeman.org) or [Brian Cornell](mailto:bcornell@campworkcoeman.org). Members of the Citizens of Shawtown, their friends, and all others interested in helping are invited.
