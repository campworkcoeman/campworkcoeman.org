The Beaver Day work day allows us to get a head start on setting up camp for another exciting season. We'll gather in the Dining Hall at 8:30 AM before beginning work at 9:00 AM. Lunch will be provided. Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

The Steak Dinner, hosted by the Citizens of Shawtown, is an annual fundraiser. Dinner begins in the Camp Workcoeman Dining Hall at 6:00 PM and is preceded by hors d'oeuvres at 5:30 PM. The cost to attend is $35 for adults and $15 for children 10 and under with all proceeds benefiting camp improvement projects.
