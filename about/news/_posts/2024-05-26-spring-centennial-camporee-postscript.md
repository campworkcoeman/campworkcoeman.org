title: Spring Centennial Camporee a Success
---

Last weekend, over 400 Scouts, Scouters, and volunteers joined us to kick the centennial celebration into high-gear with the Spring Centennial Camporee. Patrols spent the day competing in challenges at ten stations scattered throughout camp. Could they perform a rescue throw at the waterfront, build a fire in a puddle, or ace trivia questions at camp taken from [On the Shore of West Hill Pond](https://www.amazon.com/Shore-West-Hill-Pond/dp/0692250484)? After stations closed, Scouts could attend a patch sale or complete tasks for a special task while Scouters wowed our judges with their desserts in the Cast Iron Chef competition. The evening concluded with a campfire program in the packed amphitheater.

More Centennial events are still to come. Visit [campworkcoeman.org/100](https://campworkcoeman.org/100) for all the details.
