---

Summer camp is currently being planned for as scheduled; camp and council leadership are receiving and following advice and guidance from state and local health officials. Changes that have been made to certain aspects of our planning are listed below.

**'Early Bird' Payment Deadline:** The Connecticut Rivers Council has moved the deadline for payment of camp fees to June 15^th and is willing to work with units should additional arrangements be needed. All registrations should be processed and paid through [ctscouting.org](https://ctscouting.org/).

**Leader Orientation Meetings:** Scoutmaster Meetings on Saturday, April 25^th for Long Island troops and Saturdays May 2^nd and 30^th for troops from other areas will be held via 'Zoom Teleconferencing.' Information needed to join these meetings will be emailed beforehand. Topics covered include camp program, merit badge selections, medical forms, health information, and much more. A representative from every troop is asked to attend one of these meetings. Each orientation meeting will begin at 10:00 AM.

**Apply for a Campership:** Campership applications are currently being accepted--- these are funds being made available by Connecticut Rivers Council and are meant to help Scouts with financial need attend camp. Please do not hesitate to apply for a campership by clicking [HERE](https://scoutingevent.com/066-34867). The campership deadline has been extended until May 15^th.

*Additional updates will be posted on this website as they become available.* Please refer to these news articles for the most up to date information; other pages of the camp website may be out of date.
