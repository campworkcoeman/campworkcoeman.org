title: COVID-19 Update &mdash; All Regular Summer Activities Canceled
---

**All Regularly Scheduled Summer Activities Canceled:** On 12 May 2020, the Connecticut Rivers Council [announced](https://preview.mailerlite.com/y2l8g1/) that all regularly scheduled summer activities at its camps have been canceled for 2020. On 18 May 2020, the State of Connecticut Office of Early Childhood issued [revised guidance](https://www.ctoec.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/COVID-19-memo-18-youth-camp-guidance_2020.05.19-1-1.pdf) stating that "[Resident camps] will not be permitted to operate during the declared state of emergency unless and until permitted to do so by order of the Governor." Due to the severe restrictions that have been placed of day camps, the Council has decided to cancel all day camps as well.

**Activities Possible in Late Summer and Early Fall:** Here at Camp Workcoeman we know how important a summer camp experience is for you and your Scouts. As such, we are brainstorming and beginning to plan activities for the late summer and early fall in anticipation of lessened restrictions. While we do not yet know what these activities will look like, we do know that health and safety are our top priorities and that the nature of these activities will depend highly on the guidance we receive from local, state, and federal health authorities.

**Virtual Camp Experience**: For those interested, the Connecticut Rivers Council is offering a new, virtual camp experience for both Cub Scouts and Scouts BSA: Camp Kinda-Like-A. Please visit the [Council website](https://ctscouting.org/virtual-summer-camp/) for more information and to register.

*Additional updates will be posted on this website as they become available.* Please refer to these news articles for the most up to date information; other pages of the camp website may be out of date.
