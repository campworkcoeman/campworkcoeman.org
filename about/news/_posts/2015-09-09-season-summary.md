title: Summary of 2015 Season
---

With the start of the new school year, we close another amazing season at Camp
Workcoeman. Through eight weeks of operation, over 200 Cub Scouts, 1000
Boy Scouts, and 200 Venturers passed through the Workcoeman gates and
experienced another incredible summer. During this time, Scouts bonded as
troops and patrols, challenged their leadership in patrol challenges and
competitive events, worked towards completing some 3000 merit badges,
and contributed more than 2000 hours to camp service and conservation
projects. Program highlights of the summer included new merit badge offerings in
nearly all program areas, KnockerBalls on the Sports Field, a water trampoline
and blast bag on the lake, and continuation of the BSA Introductory Pistol
Shooting program. The 2015 season at Camp Workcoeman was packed with
excitement, and we thank everyone who participated in and supported the program
for the Scouts.

With eyes on the 2016 season, you can look forward to new and enhanced climbing
facilities, expanded merit badge selections, and opportunities that will help
define your Scouting career.
