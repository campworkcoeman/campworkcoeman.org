The Citizens of Shawtown is Camp Workcoeman's volunteer support group. Over the
last 30 years, the group has provided tremendous contributions of skill,
materials, and labor for new camp projects as well as maintaining the existing
camp facility. Having a camp support group like the Citizens of Shawtown is an
invaluable asset to the existence of a successful camp facility. The Citizens
of Shawtown sponsor workdays each year and also sponsor the annual Beaver Day
on the first Saturday in June, where many volunteers come together to help
complete numerous projects to improve the camp. Additionally, the group helps
in funding various projects by holding an annual fund raising steak dinner each
May.
