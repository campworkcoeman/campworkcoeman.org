The [Program Guide]({{ site.url }}/pdf/2023/2023-covered-wagon-derby-guide.pdf) for the upcoming Cub Scout [Covered Wagon Derby]({{ site.url }}/) is now available. The event takes place April 28--30, 2023 and is designed to enable Cub Scouts and Webelos to learn and practice outdoor skills related to their rank requirements during a competition with other dens and packs from the surrounding area.
 
It is themed after the ‘Wild West,’ where each den is encouraged to bring a wagon to carry supplies needed for each activity. In addition to the derby itself, this weekend program will include two nights of camping; breakfast, lunch, and dinner on Saturday; a Saturday night campfire; and a ‘Special Program.’ A commemorative patch will be presented to all Scouts in attendance.
