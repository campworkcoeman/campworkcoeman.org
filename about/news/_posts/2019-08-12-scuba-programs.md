title: Scuba at Camp Workcoeman
---

Is your unit planning on attending the Florida Sea Base? If so, get your required SCUBA certification while attending a week of Scouts BSA camp at Camp Workcoeman. Located in the scenic hills of northwestern Connecticut, Camp Workcoeman boasts one of the cleanest lakes around---perfect for learning to SCUBA dive locally in New England.

During the third and fifth weeks of Scout camp, instructors from the Enfield Scuba and Watersports will also offer a full PADI Open Water certification course. The cost of the full certification course is $550, which includes the course fee and covers a full week's stay at camp.
