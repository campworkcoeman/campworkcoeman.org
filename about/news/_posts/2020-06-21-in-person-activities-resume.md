---

As of June 17^th, units in the Connecticut Rivers Council can meet in person per the updated state guidelines.  Maximum of 25 people indoors and up to 100 people outdoors.  Social distancing and masks are still required when guidelines apply.  The chairman of the Council Risk Management Committee has come up with the following guidelines:

- Remember all aspects of youth protection.
- There must be no overnight camping.
- Activity size must be no larger than the outdoor group size allowed by the state (currently 25 indoors and 100 outdoors), counting all adults and youth.
- No participants can show evidence of any aspect of illness, nor have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 within the last two weeks. Taking temperatures is recommended (no participation over 100&thinsp;&deg;F).
- Participants can only be transported by their parent or guardian.  The purpose of this is to adhere to social distancing guidelines.
- Social distancing no less than 6' must be observed at all times, including meals and breaks.
- There can be no shared food or drink.
- Units must be prepared to disinfect bathrooms between uses.
- Masks must be worn at all times, except while eating.
- Any adult or youth becoming ill during the trip needs to be treated as a medical emergency.
