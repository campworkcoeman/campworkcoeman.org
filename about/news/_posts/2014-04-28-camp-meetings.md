---

Two pre-camp planning meetings are scheduled for your troop leadership to meet
with key members of the camp staff and develop a program that meets your needs.
Your *Camp Scoutmaster* and *Senior Patrol Leader* are urged to attend *one* of
these meetings. You will also be given information regarding camp policies and
medical form and related health information as well as procedures for your
Sunday arrival and check-in. A visit to your campsite is possible with a
Camp Commissioner.

Meetings are scheduled for Saturday, May 3, and Saturday, May 17. Each event
begins at 1:30 and takes place in the Camp Workcoeman Dining Hall. Please
verify your troop's attendance at either meeting by emailing Lou Seiser at
[lseiser@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:lseiser@campworkcoeman.org).
