title: Beaver Day and Steak Dinner
---

June 3^rd is an important and busy day at camp as both Beaver Day and our annual Steak Dinner will be held.

Beaver Day allows us to get a jump start on preparing camp for the summer season. Besides setting up tents, bunks, and mattresses, numerous other maintenance projects are carried out. Any and all help is appreciated. We'll meet at 8:30 AM to discuss projects and work will begin at 9. Lunch is provided. For more information please see the [Beaver Day Flier]({{ site.url }}/pdf/2017/2017-beaver-day.pdf).

The Steak Dinner, hosted by the Citizens of Shawtown, is our annual fundraiser. Dinner begins in the Camp Workcoeman Dining Hall at 6 PM and is preceded by hors d'oeuvres at 5:30 PM. The cost to attend is $25 for adults and $13 for children 10 and under with all proceeds benefiting camp improvement projects.
