title: Help Build a Campsite Pavilion
---

Make your campsite more enjoyable! Your unit can help contribute to and construct a campsite pavilion. Pavilions cost $2000; the project can be funded by one troop or split amongst other troops that use the campsite. An example pavilion was constructed this spring in the Tenderfoot's Compass area behind the camp office.
