title: Update on Summer Programs at Camp Workcoeman
---

Due to current realities, the Connecticut Rivers Council executive board [announced](https://preview.mailerlite.com/h8i6h6) on 23 September that it has decided to suspend week long summer camp operations at Camp Workcoeman. There will, however, still be be a summer season at Workcoeman in 2021, but it will be different from what it has been in the past. While details are still being worked out, we hope to offer short-term summer camping programs as well as day and family camping opportunities. A lot will happen between now and then (including with the course of the pandemic), but we promise to keep you informed and hope to see you on the shores of West Hill Pond in the not too distant future.
