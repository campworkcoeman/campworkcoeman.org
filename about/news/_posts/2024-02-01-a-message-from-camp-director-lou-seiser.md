The Connecticut Rivers Council is implementing a new process of maintaining and improving our camp properties. During this transition time, our friend and Ranger at Camp Workcoeman, Frank Galliher, has decided to pursue other opportunities. Frank's dedication and contributions to Camp Workcoeman are immensely appreciated. We all wish Frank and his family the very best.

That said, at a time of transition, it is not uncommon for rumors to surface. I want to assure you that Camp Workcoeman is here to stay. It is NOT closing, and it is NOT being sold. We will continue to offer monthly programs and dynamic summer program opportunities for Cub Scouts and Scouts BSA members while also serving as the Council's Leadership Development Center.

As we celebrate this Centennial season, we look forward to the next one hundred years of Scouting at Camp Workcoeman!
