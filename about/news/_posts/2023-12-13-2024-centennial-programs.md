title: 2024 Centennial Celebration
---

2024 marks Camp Workcoeman's 100^th anniversary! We have a number of activities planned for 2024 to celebrate the centennial. Throughout our centennial, there will be a variety of ways we will mark the passion, the friendships, and the experiences that have made and continue to make Camp Workcoeman a truly special place. We will also use this opportunity to look ahead to the next century of Scouting at Workcoeman and to how we will continue to evolve while maintaining the same mission to good Scouting that makes Workcoeman the place it is.

Visit [campworkcoeman.org/100]({{ site.url }}/100/) for more information and an up-to-date list of centennial programs.
