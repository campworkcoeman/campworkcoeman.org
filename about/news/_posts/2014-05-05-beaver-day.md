Beaver Day is scheduled for Saturday, June 7, 2014. This very important day
will bring Scouters together from all over the council to tackle the huge task
of preparing Camp Workcoeman for the summer camp season.

All kinds of projects are scheduled and we need your help! Skills and equipment
are needed for tasks such as carpentry, painting, electrical, plumbing as well
as just plain help!

We will gather for coffee and... at 8:30 am to review projects. Then we'll
begin the work projects at 9:00 am. Lunch will be provided.

Please confirm that you will attend with either Ranger Frank at
[rangerfrank@sbcglobal.net](mailto:rangerfrank@sbcglobal.net) or Lou at
[lseiser@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:lseiser@campworkcoeman.org).

Be sure to tell if you have a special skill. This will enable correct planning
for projects and materials.
