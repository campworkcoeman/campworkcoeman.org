title: Trail Crew a Success
---

The trail crew held this weekend was a success. Despite the snow cover hinding
what could be done, crews using axes and two-man crosscut saws cleared the vast
majority of trees that had fallen on the trails over the past few years, and
others posted signs delineating Workcoeman's western and northern property
boundaries.

A big thank you to the Scouts and Scouters that helped with the trail crew
projects this weekend. Much appreciation to the group of staff members, Troop
121, Troop 23, Troop 18, Troop 3, Troop 6, Troop 425, Troop 68, and camp alumni
who toiled to improve Workcoeman's trails.
