A letter from Brian Cornell, chairman of the *Citizens of Shawtown*:
 
> Hello fellow Citizens!
> 
> The COVID-19 crisis is something that none of us have experienced before and in everything that we do moving forward, we all must do our part to end this situation. As each day has ticked by over the past weeks and months, **it has become clear to me that any attempt to hold our Annual Steak and Chicken Dinner and Silent Auction on June 6^th safely, will just not happen as scheduled this year.** I do not make this decision lightly and have discussed this at length with Lou and Frank for their valuable input prior to making my decision. Ultimately, the safety and well-being of all is paramount and comes first!
> 
> That is not to say a similar event cannot be planned for later this Summer or Fall, but we need to continue proper due diligence at this time until the experts and many others can tell us more. As you know, the Citizens of Shawtown rely heavily on this annual fundraiser to assist us in our support of our beloved Camp Workcoeman!
> 
> As you can imagine, the process of just maintaining camp will also be tremendously affected. An alternative plan to accomplish this huge task has been discussed between me, Lou, Ranger Frank and the Council office. We have arranged for special one person projects to be available to Citizens members OR as small groups with those whom you have been quarantined, such as family members. That said, **we MUST still adhere to all CDC and social-distancing guidelines as any of these projects are carried out.**
> 
> If you have the time and desire to help us continue our mission at Camp Workcoeman here in 2020, I would ask that you please contact Ranger Frank **directly** at [rangerfrank@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:rangerfrank@campworkcoeman.org) to discuss the list we have prepared and to choose one or more tasks that you would be willing to take on. The Ranger will have all supplies and tools ready for you on the day you choose, staged at your specific work site. Once you are done with your task and depart, the Ranger will collect tools, etc. and return them to the Maintenance building.
> 
> Hopefully the COVID-19 crisis will improve soon enabling us to have a clearer picture as to preparing for the possibility of another great summer at Camp Workcoeman.Â That determination will come from our Council office in the weeks to come. For now, we still have work to do and we can all rise to the occasion by stepping-up to the plate. Already, several Citizens members have jumped into action! PLEASE contact Ranger Frank to do your part!

> Thank you all for ALL YOU DO!
