A excerpt from a letter from Brian Cornell, chairman of the *Citizens of Shawtown*:
 
> The COVID-19 crisis is something that none of us have experienced before and in everything that we do moving forward, we all must do our part to end this situation. As each day has ticked by over the past weeks and months, **it has become clear to me that any attempt to hold our Annual Steak and Chicken Dinner and Silent Auction on June 6^th safely, will just not happen as scheduled this year.** I do not make this decision lightly and have discussed this at length with Lou and Frank for their valuable input prior to making my decision. Ultimately, the safety and well-being of all is paramount and comes first!
> 
> That is not to say a similar event cannot be planned for later this Summer or Fall, but we need to continue proper due diligence at this time until the experts and many others can tell us more. As you know, the Citizens of Shawtown rely heavily on this annual fundraiser to assist us in our support of our beloved Camp Workcoeman!
