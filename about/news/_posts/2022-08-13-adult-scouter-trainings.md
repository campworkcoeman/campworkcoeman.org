[Introduction to Outdoor Leader Skills](https://scoutingevent.com/066-56079) will take place September 9--11; this is the outdoors component of the required courses to be a 'trained' Scouts BSA Scouter. [Level I Archery Instructor Training](https://scoutingevent.com/066-61484) will take place September 17. This is the 'hands on' portion of the training; the online portion must be completed beforehand.
