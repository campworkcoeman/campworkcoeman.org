title: BSA Expands Program to Welcome Girls
---

Big changes in the Scouting program in the year ahead! The Boy Scouts of America's Board of Directors has agreed to welcome girls into the Cub Scout Program beginning next year; a program for older girls will be announced next year and become available in 2019. Once council details are set, get in touch for information about how you can make sure your pack or troop can provide a quality summer experience to ALL youth!

For years, Camp Workcoeman has been home to Laurel Music Camp, a coed group of high school students that come together and camp for a week.

Workcoeman is ready to support the needs of young men and women as they advance and have fun in the Scouting program.
