Registration for summer 2023 Scouts BSA programs at Camp Workcoeman is now open. Visit [campworkcoeman.org/2023]({{ site.url }}/2023) for full details.

New for summer 2023, Camp Workcoeman will be offering week-long Scouts BSA Powder Horn and National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) courses. Building on the success of the past couple of seasons, Camp Workcoeman will continue to offer a variety of short-term opportunities for both Scouts BSA and Cub Scout participants throughout the summer of 2023. This includes day and family camp for Cub Scouts and one and two day merit badges, a la carte activities/rentals, and scuba certification for Scouts BSA. In addition, overnight unit and family camping is available all summer.

Most information on Scouts BSA programs is now available on this website; remaining information on Scouts BSA programs, the Scouts BSA Summer Program Guide, and information on summer Cub Scouts programs will be added in the coming weeks.
