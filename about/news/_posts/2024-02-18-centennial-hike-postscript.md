title: Centennial Celebration Kicks Off with a Five Mile Hike
---

Nine hikers explored Shawtown on Saturday.  They hiked for about five miles and saw several springs, the former Wright Homestead, the four-corners, and the sheep pen.  The hikers learned about the Convention Army and a bit about the 19^th century rural economy.  A lovely light snow fell for much of the morning, with the clouds lifting just as the hikers reached the Camp Overlook.
