Update on recent Shawtown activity at camp: Our workday at camp on November 23^rd was a great success, especially due to the large turnout of Shawtown members. It was great!

We were able to nearly complete the metal roofing installation on the Pole Barn (only two more panels to go!). Crews also split large amounts of wood at both the Weed Lodge and Griffin Lodge locations for use this winter by troops attending camp, made repairs to the Dining Hall shingles as needed, completed the installation of the ridge cap on the Director's cabin, and made repairs to several items under the Dining Hall storage area.

Those attending were provided lunch and beverages along with great conversation and fellowship. Thanks to all who were able to attend before Old Man Winter sets in!
