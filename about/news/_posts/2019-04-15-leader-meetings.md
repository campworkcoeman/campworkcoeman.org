title: Pre-Camp Planning Meetings
---

Summer is fast approaching. To make sure you and your troop are prepared, we ask that each troop sends their camp Scoutmaster and Senior Patrol Leader to *one* of our pre-camp planning meetings. We will discuss information on new merit badges, program opportunities, medical form preparations, and everything you need to know for planning your troop's summer camp experience.

Meetings will be held in the Camp Workcoeman Dining Hall on May 11^th and 18^th beginning at 1:30 PM. An additional meeting for Long Island troops will be held April 27^th beginning at 10:00 AM in St. Raymond's School Cafeteria (263 Atlantic Avenue, East Rockaway, NY 11518). It is only necessary to attend one of these meetings. Please confirm attendance to the Camp Director, Lou Seiser ([lseiser@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:lsesier@campworkcoeman.org)).
