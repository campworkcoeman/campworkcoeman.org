> Dear Lou,

> I felt compelled to write a letter of appreciation as soon as we returned
> home from week 3 at Workcoeman.

> Our twenty-seven Scouts and six adult leaders that attended camp were
> pleasantly impressed by the way you run Camp. The Staff you have amassed is
> one of the highest caliber we have seen anywhere in our travels. To be in
> your third week of Camp and fifth week overall, all the staff members acted
> as if we were the first campers of the summer. Talk about "Catching the
> Spirit!" Your many years of hard work are reflected in the group of
> individuals you choose to surround yourself with. Many of my Scouts commented
> on specific incidents in which a staff member went to the extreme to afford
> the opportunity for advancement or learning. Contrary to the idea at Camp
> Workcoeman that this is what Scout Camp is all about, too many other camps
> and staffs are in it for the money only.

> Your program has enough structure to provide for necessary scheduling,
> however, your staff and equipment was capable of meeting the needs of troops
> with varied agendas. The physical portion of the camp is in excellent shape
> to serve your enrollment. Any areas that we felt could be improved on; you
> have already taken into account in your long-range plan.

> As a Scoutmaster of a large Troop, I have been looking for the type of camp I
> remember as a Scout...one where the "Scouting Spirit" was embedded in the
> staff. We as a Troop have been accepting a less than perfect Summer Camp for
> some time. I do believe that your staff, facility, and dedicated leadership
> have shown us that we do not have to settle for anything else.

> I'm sure we'll be talking more throughout the year, and are already planning
> new "purple spirits" to bring to camp next year.

> Yours in Scouting,  
> Gary R. Aber
