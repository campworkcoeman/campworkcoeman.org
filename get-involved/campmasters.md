## Who are the Campmasters?

The Camp Workcoeman Campmasters Corps is made of adult volunteers throughout
the Connecticut Rivers Council. They are trained, registered Scouters who have
an interest in making the Weekend Outdoor Experience a successful one for all
units that choose to come to Camp Workcoeman. After a short orientation
program, they each choose from two to four weekends per year to stay at the
camp helping check units in at the beginning of their stay and supporting the
units' needs. They also keep a watchful eye on the camp facilities to help
ensure campers properly take care of the property.

The Campmaster Program is a national program with guidelines set up from
National, the local council and the camp where they volunteer. The main
function of the Campmaster is to be a friendly and supportive addition to the
Weekend Camp Staff.

All Campmasters are a resource to the Camp Ranger. Meetings are scheduled to
evaluate its program, make scheduling assignments, and arrange for the training
of any new members. All Campmasters must have a record of demonstrated ability
to get along with people, to lead, and to act in an emergency.

All Campmasters must have a working knowledge of the Scouting program and
advancement. Registered Scouters, with experience in Cub Scouts, Scouts BSA, and
Venturing are eligible for consideration as Campmasters.

If you are interested in being a Campmaster, please contact Ranger Frank
Galliher at (860) 379-2207 or [rangerfrank@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:rangerfrank@campworkcoeman.org).
