## Who are the Citizens of Shawtown?

The Citizens of Shawtown is a group of people who work together to support the
program at Camp Workcoeman. The name of the group was derived from an old
settlement that is located on the outer area of Camp Workcoeman. Many members
of the group attended Workcoeman as youth or as adults, and some even served on
the camp staff.

## What we do...

The purpose of the Citizens of Shawtown is to organize and complete projects at
Camp Workcoeman to enhance and improve the camp facility.

Each year in February, the Citizens meet to identify maintenance projects. Some
of the projects are major construction while others are maintenance related. A
schedule of workdays is arranged to complete the project list.

The Citizens work closely with the camp ranger to coordinate projects for Order
of the Arrow ordeal weekends too. Some of the members are skilled in various
vocations while others have valuable contacts for materials and services.

The Citizens also fund projects from fund-raisers such as an annual Steak and
Chicken Dinner! We do not collect dues from the membership.

## Newsletter

The Citizens of Shawtown periodically publishes a newsletter updating its members about the organization's activities and about happenings at camp. The newsletter is sent to members and posted on the camp website.
