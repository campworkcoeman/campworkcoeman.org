>> In honor of Camp Workcoeman's 100^th anniversary, the Camp Workcoeman Alumni Association offered 100 framed limited edition silver accented patches as gifts in exchange for donations of $100 or more. Each patch was made with metallic silver thread and came in a handcrafted wooden frame suitable for display. Funds went toward furthering the Alumni Association's mission of ensuring that financial constraints do not prevent any Scout from attending programs at Camp Workcoeman.
