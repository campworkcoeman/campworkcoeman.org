## Shawtown Work Days

Pre-planned mini-work parties (in conjunction with the Ranger's needs) will be held from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM on the 3^rd Saturday of each month. Coffee "and" at 8:30 AM and lunch will be provided. We will tackle jobs large and small throughout the camp to assure an awesome experience for any Scouts or Scouters attending Camp Workcoeman this year and for years to come!
