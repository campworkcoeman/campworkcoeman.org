## Shawtown Work Days

Pre-planned mini-work parties (in conjunction with the Ranger's needs) will be held from 8:30 AM to 3:00 PM on (generally) the 4^th Saturday of each month. Coffee "and" at 8:30 AM and lunch will be provided. We will tackle jobs large and small throughout the camp to assure an awesome experience for any Scouts or Scouters attending Camp Workcoeman this year and for years to come!

If you plan on attending, please register on the [council website](https://scoutingevent.com/066-34204) or email Ranger Frank ([rangerfrank@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:rangerfrank@campworkcoeman.org)) by the Sunday before the work day to let him know you're coming; he'll let you know by the following Wednesday the projects to be addressed and any special attire or equipment needs.
