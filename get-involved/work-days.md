## Shawtown Work Days

Pre-planned mini-work parties (in conjunction with the Ranger's needs) will be held from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM on various Saturdays throughout the year; in 2024, these workdays are scheduled so as not to conflict with other activities at camp where volunteers are needed. The day starts with coffee "and" at 8:45 AM and lunch will be provided. We will tackle jobs large and small throughout the camp to assure an awesome experience for any Scouts or Scouters attending Camp Workcoeman this year and for years to come!

If you plan on attending, please email Brian Cornell ([bcornell@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:bcornell@campworkcoeman.org)) by the Wednesday before the work day to let him know you're coming; he'll let you know the projects to be addressed and any special attire or equipment needs.
