## Camp Staff

Opportunities to serve Scouting as a member of the Connecticut Rivers Council Summer Camp staff at Camp
Workcoeman are available to outstanding applicants who are members of the Boy Scouts of America. Competition for employment
is rigorous; the jobs demanding; the experience exhilarating.

The camp is dedicated to supporting each unit's outdoor and advancement program
while giving each boy an enriching long term camping experience.

Applicants are considered for positions without regard to race, color,
religion, sex, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, marital status, veteran
status, or the presence of a disability or any category protected by applicable law.

* The minimum age accepted is 15; however, it is strongly recommended that
  those who seek a camp staff position should have previously participated in
  the Counselors in Training (CIT) Program. Boy Scouts of America standards
  require ages 18 and 21 minimum for some positions.
* All staff, as a condition of employment, are required to be registered members of the Boy Scouts of America.
* The principles of the Scout Oath and Law must be practiced as a way of life.
* The staff is expected to set an example of excellence in Scouting, which
  includes the proper wearing of the Scout uniform.

Director Lou Seiser at [lseiser@campworkcoeman.org](mailto:lseiser@campworkcoeman.org).

## Counselor In Training Program

The CIT program offers an exciting opportunity for those who would like to
learn about the camp operation from the staff viewpoint. As a CIT, you will
learn leadership skills, will become knowledgeable of camp operations, and
will develop teaching skills.

The CIT Program is a one (1) week commitment. The program is designed to
instill the knowledge and values that are expected of all Camp Workcoeman staff
members. Participants will work in all areas of camp and gain first-hand
experiences to understand what it really takes to operate the high-quality
programs of Camp Workcoeman.

The cost of the program is $150. Participants must be at least 14 years old.
All participants will be evaluated at the end of the week and could be offered
to stay for another week based on their performance.

Those who successfully complete this program will be seriously considered for
future camp staff positions. Those that participate in the CIT Program enhance
their possibility of being hired to the staff, but participation does not
guarantee a position. Please understand that participation in the CIT program
in no way guarantees employment.
