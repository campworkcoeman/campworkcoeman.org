## Unit Camping

Scouting units are able to reserve inner loop campsites (Nathan Hale, Baden Powell, Tunxis, Kahagon, Seton, Outpost) any night of the week all summer (Friday and Saturday night must be reserved together). Canvas tents with cots, canopies, latrines, and showers will be available. If units bring their own food, ice and/or refrigeration may be available upon request. Additionally, prepared food is available for purchase with sufficient notice; please see the order form (at the bottom of this page) for details.

## À La Carte Programs

While at camp, units should plan their own programs but Scouts may sign up for day programs offered during their stay. Certain camp facilities (shooting ranges, waterfront, climbing wall, etc.) are available for rent for an additional fee. Camp will provide staffing as needed. Click the link below for more information and prices. If you have questions, contact [Jeff Seiser](mailto:jseiser@campworkcoeman.org).

## Family Camping

Family camping is available in the Tee Pee campsite which features standard and deluxe tents as well as an upgrade latrine. This opportunity is ideal for families with a Scout attending multiple concurrent day programs or those that just want to spend a few days outdoors. Several options are available: (1) bring your own tent for $15/night, (2) standard 7'x9' canvas tents with cots for $25/night, and (3) deluxe 12'x16' canvas tents with bedding for $50/night.
