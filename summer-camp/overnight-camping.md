## Unit Camping

Scouting units are able to reserve inner loop campsites (Nathan Hale, Baden Powell, Tunxis, Kahagon, Seton, Outpost) any night of the week all summer (Friday and Saturday night must be reserved together). Canvas tents with cots, canopies, latrines, and showers will be available. If units bring their own food, ice and/or refrigeration may be available upon request. Additionally, prepared food is available for purchase with sufficient notice; please see the order form (at the bottom of this page) for details.

## À La Carte Programs

While at camp, units should plan their own programs but Scouts may sign up for day programs offered during their stay. Certain camp facilities (shooting ranges, waterfront, climbing wall, etc.) are available for rent for an additional fee. Camp will provide staffing as needed. Click the link below for more information and prices. If you have questions, contact [Jeff Seiser](mailto:jseiser@campworkcoeman.org).

## Meals

Upon request, Camp Workcoeman can prepare meals for your unit or family while they are in camp this summer. Meals will be served in the Dining Hall. Breakfast is $6, lunch is $8, and dinner is $10. Meal requests must be made at least two weeks in advance, and payment will be collected at camp.
