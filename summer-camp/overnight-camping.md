## Unit Camping

Scouting units will be able to reserve inner loop campsites (Nathan Hale, Baden Powell, Tunxis, Kahagon, Seton, Outpost) any night of the week between 5 July 2021 and 14 August 2021 (Friday and Saturday night must be reserved together). Canvas tents with cots, canopies, latrines, and showers will be available. Units must provide their own food but ice and/or refrigeration may be available upon request.

While at camp, units should plan their own programs but Scouts may sign up for day programs offered during their stay. Certain camp facilities (shooting ranges, waterfront, climbing wall, etc.) may be available for rent for an additional fee. Units will be responsible for providing their own certified instructors/lifeguards; camp may assist in locating one.

## Family Camping

Family camping will be available in the Tee Pee campsite which features standard and deluxe tents as well as an upgrade latrine. This opportunity is ideal for families with a Scout attending multiple concurrent day programs or those that just want to spend a few days outdoors.
