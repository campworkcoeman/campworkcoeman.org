## Unit Camping

Scouting units will be able to reserve inner loop campsites (Nathan Hale, Baden Powell, Tunxis, Kahagon, Seton, Outpost) any night of the week between 5 July 2021 and 14 August 2021 (Friday and Saturday night must be reserved together). Canvas tents with cots, canopies, latrines, and showers will be available. Units must provide their own food but ice and/or refrigeration may be available upon request.

## À La Carte Programs

While at camp, units should plan their own programs but Scouts may sign up for day programs offered during their stay. Certain camp facilities (shooting ranges, waterfront, climbing wall, etc.) may be available for rent for an additional fee. Camp will provide staffing as needed.

## Family Camping

Family camping will be available in the Tee Pee campsite which features standard and deluxe tents as well as an upgrade latrine.

Several options are available: (1) bring your own tent for $15/night, (2) standard 7'x9' canvas tents with cots for $25/night, and (3) deluxe 12'x16' canvas tents with bedding for $50/night.

## COVID Safety

We know the importance of getting youth outdoors and involved in the programs of Adventure.  We are taking every step to ensure that this summer will be SAFE and FUN!  Camp will be awesome this summer, but it will look a little different than what we are used to.  We have instituted protocols and procedures in order to keep our Scouts, Scouters, staff, and families healthy and safe.  The procedures and safety measures have been promoted by federal agencies and the American Camping Association Field Guide for Camps. These multi-layered strategies prove effective and reduce the risk of transmission. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/33wn554u">Learn more</a> about specific COVID guidelines.
