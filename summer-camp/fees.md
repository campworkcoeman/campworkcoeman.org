The fees to attend week-long Resident Summer Camp in 2015 are as follows.

### Scout Fees

Early Fee: $390
: A $50 deposit per **named** Scout camper is due no later than March 4, 2015.
  If paid in full by May 15, 2015, the fee will be $390; payments received
  after May 15, 2015 will be charged a late fee of $50, making the total fee
  $440.

Regular Fee: $415
: A $50 deposit per **named** Scout added to your camp roster after
  March 5, 2015. If paid in full by May 15, 2015, the fee will be $415.
  Payments received after May 15, 2015 will be charged a late fee of $50,
  making the total fee $465.

### Discounts for Scouts

Encore (2^nd week of camp): $290
: The registration process will require the Scout's other camp/week to be
  identified. To qualify, a Scout must have already spent a week in a
  Connecticut Rivers Council Scout Camp, and the discount applies to a
  second week at one of the Connecticut Rivers Council's camps.

### Adult Scouter Fees

Fees for extra Scouters are calculated at $15 per day/$90 per week. Names of
Scouters are not required until May 15. Two Scouters are free. Additional
Scouters may be free according to the schedule below:

 # of youth per program | # of free Scouters | all additional adults
------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------
  5--10                 | 2                  | $90
 11--20                 | 3                  | $90
 21--30                 | 4                  | $90
 31--40                 | 5                  | $90

### Webelos Crossovers & New Scouts

These Scouts are always afforded the lowest possible camp fee rate. Because
many troops don't know what Webelos will be joing their troop until after the
March 4 deposit date, a special registration category will be established for
them. This will also include any boys who join the troop as new Scouts between
March 5 and the beginning of the troop's week at camp. This registration will
be available May 16.

### Camperships

The Connecticut Rivers Council will continue to award camperships to assist
Scouts in need of funds to attend camp who might not otherwise do so. The
annual campership fund is limited and fluctuates from year to year. Similar to
Webelos crossovers and new Scouts, campership Scouts will also be afforded the
lowest possible rate to attend camp. The unit process for paying for these
Scouts is to be determined.

### Specialty Camp Programs

Registration for all Specialty Camp programs will be accomplished by the
individual. These programs will include Trail to Eagle, NRA Shooting Sports,
AdVenture Camp, Robotics & Technology, and various other daily or weekend
programs.

### Payments

**All** deposits and subsequent payments for camp **must** be made online
through your MyCouncil page on the Connecticut Rivers Council web site.
Payments may be in the form of an E-Check or credit card. There is no charge to
the unit using this method of payment.

### Camp Cards Are Back For 2015

The Connecticut Rivers Council is happy to offer Camp Cards again in 2015. For
$5.00, each camp card provides over $100 in value with coupon specials from
area businesses offering fast food, travel, recreation, and more. Sale ends
May 1, 2015. The program provides a benefit to the individual units and helps
the Council in providing programs. Units participating in this program will
earn a $2.00 commission on each $5 Camp Card they sell (if paid for by May 15).
The program is open to all packs, troops, crews, and posts. For more
information, see [ctrivers.org](http://www.ctrivers.org/Council/ElectronicScouter/CampCards15).

### FAQs

Question
: I don't know what Scouts in my troop are going to attend camp by the March
4^th Early Fee deposit date. Why should I make a deposit for the "unknown"?

Answer
: Camp promotion is a year round process. The unit's camp plans should already
  be on the family's calendars. Units also should have a pretty good idea of
  the percentage of Scouts in the troop that attends camp. Register and make
  deposits for that number of **named** Scouts. Deposits may later be
  transferred between Scouts.

<br/>
Question
: We know our troop has Scouts that need Campership assistance in order to
  attend camp. Should we register them with a $50 deposit by March 4^th?

Answer
: Yes, but not necessarily. As stated above, campership applicants are always
  afforded the lowest possible camp fee. Naming them by March 4 helps the Camp
  Directors in planning for a great summer program.
