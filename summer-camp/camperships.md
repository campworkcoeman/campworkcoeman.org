## CW Alumni Association Camperships (Year-Round)

The Camp Workcoeman Alumni Association is a separate 501\(c)(3) organization dedicated to ensuring every Scout can enjoy Scouting experiences at Camp Workcoeman. The Association provides year-round camperships to supplement the summer ones offered by the Council; as such, they request that families apply for a Council campership first when applicable. The Association will supplement Council funding for summer programs when the Council has not met a family's full financial need. For more information and to request a campership, please email the group's treasurer, [Tom Leisten](mailto:tleisten@campworkcoeman.org).

## CT Rivers Council Camperships (Summer Only)

The Connecticut Rivers Council believes all Scouts should have the opportunity to attend summer camp, no matter their financial situation. Therefore, the Connecticut Rivers Council is pleased to offer camperships to Scouts who are members of the Connecticut Rivers Council who attend a Connecticut Rivers Council Camp. Camperships are subject to available funding and may also be available for out-of-Council Scouts. Camperships are the equivalent of a school scholarship but for summer camp. They are awarded based upon financial need. Camperships are made possible by the Council's [Camp4All](https://fundraise.givesmart.com/vf/Peers4Camp) campaign.

**Except** on rare occasions, Camperships are **NOT** granted for amounts greater than 50% of the camp fee.  Camperships are awarded for ONE (1) camp session per Scout.  Camperships are not transferrable between Scouts.  Please file a separate application for EACH individual in a household requesting a Campership.

The deadline for the submissions is April 1^st.  Any Campership applications received after April 1^st may be put into a pool for consideration of any remaining funds.
