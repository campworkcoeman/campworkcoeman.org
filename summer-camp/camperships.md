## CW Alumni Association Camperships (Year-Round)

The Camp Workcoeman Alumni Association is a separate 501\(c)(3) organization dedicated to ensuring every Scout can enjoy Scouting experiences at Camp Workcoeman. The Association provides year-round camperships to supplement the summer ones offered by the Council; as such, they request that families apply for a Council campership first when applicable. The Association will supplement Council funding for summer programs when the Council has not met a family's full financial need. For more information and to request a campership, please email the group's treasurer, [Tom Leisten](mailto:tleisten@campworkcoeman.org).

## CT Rivers Council Camperships (Summer Only)

The Connecticut Rivers Council believes all Scouts should have the opportunity to attend summer camp, no matter their financial situation. Therefore, the Connecticut Rivers Council is pleased to offer camperships to Scouts who are members of the Connecticut Rivers Council who attend a Connecticut Rivers Council Camp.  Camperships are subject to available funding. Camperships are the equivalent of a school scholarship but for summer camp. They are awarded based upon financial need as determined by the most recent 1040 tax form.  Extenuating circumstances may be considered.   

**Except** on rare occasions, Camperships are **NOT** granted for amounts greater than 50% of the camp fee.  Camperships are awarded for ONE (1) camp session per Scout.  Camperships are not transferrable between Scouts.  Please file a separate application for EACH individual in a household requesting a Campership (however only one tax form is required to be provided to the council per family).  

The deadline for the submissions is April 1^st.  Any Campership applications received after April 15^st (or incomplete campership applications not completed before April 1^st) will be put into a pool for consideration of any remaining funds.
